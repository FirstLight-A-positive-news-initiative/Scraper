According to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. At the start of the COP the latest analysis from the UN suggested a rise of 2.7C.

2,Climate change: National Trust joins international call for peat product ban,"The National Trust is calling on the government to ban peat being used in compost, as part of efforts to try and limit climate change.It is one of more than a dozen international organisations asking for a switch to sustainable alternatives. Peat bogs are a carbon sink - meaning they soak up carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming.The UK government has already said it intends to ban the sale of peat compost to the public in England by 2024.But in a joint statement on peat, the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland - as well as similar groups including from Ireland, Korea and Indonesia - urged the government to ""act now"" and ban the sale of peat products in horticulture entirely.They made the call to coincide with the COP26 climate summit negotiations.Peat is the surface layer of soil, made up primarily of partially decomposed plant material which has developed in waterlogged and low oxygen conditions. It is filled with nutrients ideal for plant growth and is often used in compost, as well as harvested and burned as fuel. Research shows peatland traps almost twice as much carbon as forests, despite covering just 3% of the earth's surface. But peat bogs that have been drained, dug up for fuel or used in compost have the opposite effect and contributes to carbon emissions.The National Trust said healthy peatlands also help to control flooding and encourage vegetation that can provide homes for wildlife.The organisation, which is one of the largest landowners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it was taking action to eliminate the use of peat in its gardens and supply chains.National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said the international organisations were ""all taking action"" to eliminate the use of peat, but added ""we can't end this practice alone"".She called on members to ""make a positive choice for climate and for nature"" and buy peat-free compost to use in their gardens, as well as check whether plants they buy are peat free.Ms McGrady said: ""It is through this sort of collective effort that we can unite in the fight against climate change.""We also need government to step up and play their part by bringing in legislation that bans the sale of products containing peat.""Leading garden centres in the UK have been found to be failing to stop the sale of peat in compost, despite pressure from campaigners and government.Last year countryside charity CPRE warned emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reductions  made through new and existing forests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/63D4/production/_121465552_hi071788726.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59195535,science
3,COP26: Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest,"About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.The protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.Greta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.Police arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. Officers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.However the force said the day passed ""largely without incident"". The ""Global Day of Action for Climate Justice"" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.In London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. The opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""It was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.Away from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"".  He tweeted: ""Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.""We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.""Police Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. A spokesperson said: ""We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.""After the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been ""generally good natured"", with people in ""high spirits"".He confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.He said: ""Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.""Despite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. Flags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.One enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for £3.There was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. Members of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.A helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.One group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.The event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.They were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.One of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.It was summed by a banner which read: ""Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists"".The sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.But the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  World leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.But there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.Countries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. ""This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.""Representatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. Some have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. Marchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.Edinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of ""Pedal on COP26"" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.The cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.Police said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of ""congestion issues"". ""Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,"" a Police Scotland tweet said. Bleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. High winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. Saturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BCBC/production/_121461384_071792390-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59185007,science
4,COP26: Why we marched in Glasgow,"Tens of thousands of people have braved the wet and windy conditions in Glasgow to take part in the biggest mass protest of the COP26 summit.A huge column of activists made its way from Kelvingrove Park to the city centre, and on to a rally on Glasgow Green. Some of them explained why they felt it was so important to be there. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, has travelled to Glasgow from Cornwall for the rally. The 46-year-old said: ""The ocean is front and centre of the impact of climate change but it is also part of the solution.""He said the charity's supporters were taking part in events across the country to highlight the impact of human and plastic waste. He added: "" I think campaigners are having an effect and I believe the next decade will be the most radical period of environmental action the world has ever seen.""Retired designer Charlie Rohan travelled from Edinburgh to take part in the march. He made his own sign for the occasion but as the rain lashed down he admitted: ""The cardboard is getting heavier by the minute.""Asked why he made the journey, the father-of-two said: ""This is our last chance. If we don't take action now then COP 27, 28 and 29 will be a waste of time.""The 61-year-old is a keen walker and expressed dismay at the amount of rubbish he encounters washed up on Scotland's coastlines. He added: ""The UK says it is a leader on climate change but we need to follow that through.""Ruby Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people in India. She said: ""When you look at climate change the most vulnerable people will be the most impacted. ""Indigenous people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. ""The consequences are devastating.""The London-based student was joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival International. The group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who face persecution and displacement.She said: ""We have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels.""And we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.""Amalen S has travelled to Glasgow from Malaysia with Friends Of The Earth International, campaigning against carbon markets.To illustrate their point they have built a large ""carbon unicorn"" head - Amalen tells the BBC it emits smoke when up and running.""Carbon market is the same thing as chasing a carbon unicorn, it sounds amazing but it doesn't exist,"" said Amalen.The group has organised a number of demos throughout the summit, including one at the SEC on Friday.Amalen is also part of the Activist Network and his work involves helping people express their views on climate change through artwork.""A lot of lobbying happens behind closed doors,"" he added.Glasgow students Xavier, Ben, Sophie and Abby were giving out flyers for Beyond the Green, an event with live music and speakers promoting sustainability and the use of hemp during COP26.Ben, who studies sound production, said: ""Its a great material to use instead of non-biodegradeables. It can be used to create anything from houses, rope, clothes and food.""He added climate change is something he has always thought about, and tried his best to recycle and go ""beyond the bare minimum"" to live sustainably.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4340/production/_121461271_surferhugo_bbc.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59191466,science
5,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". ""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". ""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

6,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon as the planet can absorb.If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon than their share.One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DE9/production/_121435711_gettyimages-815252586.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59157836,science
7,COP26: Time to sober up,"So how much progress has really been made in the opening days of COP26 and what are the main challenges that lie ahead?To paraphrase COP26 president Alok Sharma, this is the moment when the rubber is finally meeting the road. After a first week dominated by a blizzard of announcements of new initiatives in the real world, the conference is now moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations.The main focus will still be on devising a plan to bend the temperature curve below 1.5C.There has been quite a bit of speculation that the first week announcements made by countries and the new pledges on methane and coal have already moved the needle on the rise in global temperatures that's likely this century. According to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. At the start of the COP the latest analysis from the UN suggested a rise of 2.7C. So just how real is this large predicted drop?""None of the countries that has a net zero target has implemented sufficient short term policies to put itself on a trajectory towards net zero,"" said Dr Niklas Höhne, from the New Climate Institute, who monitor and assess national carbon cutting plans.""Right now it's more a vision, or imagination. And it's not matched by action.""As one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. Next week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. These will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. Some progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions.As deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous.""It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,"" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. ""I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work.""There will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. There is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. Despite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. The cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return.""Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,"" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. The failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. While the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely.For the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. UK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a ""cover decision"", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. The key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. The most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time.There is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed.""You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,"" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank.""I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement.""""It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.""Matt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

8,Climate change: National Trust joins international call for peat product ban,"The National Trust is calling on the government to ban peat being used in compost, as part of efforts to try and limit climate change.It is one of more than a dozen international organisations asking for a switch to sustainable alternatives. Peat bogs are a carbon sink - meaning they soak up carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming.The UK government has already said it intends to ban the sale of peat compost to the public in England by 2024.But in a joint statement on peat, the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland - as well as similar groups including from Ireland, Korea and Indonesia - urged the government to ""act now"" and ban the sale of peat products in horticulture entirely.They made the call to coincide with the COP26 climate summit negotiations.Peat is the surface layer of soil, made up primarily of partially decomposed plant material which has developed in waterlogged and low oxygen conditions. It is filled with nutrients ideal for plant growth and is often used in compost, as well as harvested and burned as fuel. Research shows peatland traps almost twice as much carbon as forests, despite covering just 3% of the earth's surface. But peat bogs that have been drained, dug up for fuel or used in compost have the opposite effect and contributes to carbon emissions.The National Trust said healthy peatlands also help to control flooding and encourage vegetation that can provide homes for wildlife.The organisation, which is one of the largest landowners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it was taking action to eliminate the use of peat in its gardens and supply chains.National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said the international organisations were ""all taking action"" to eliminate the use of peat, but added ""we can't end this practice alone"".She called on members to ""make a positive choice for climate and for nature"" and buy peat-free compost to use in their gardens, as well as check whether plants they buy are peat free.Ms McGrady said: ""It is through this sort of collective effort that we can unite in the fight against climate change.""We also need government to step up and play their part by bringing in legislation that bans the sale of products containing peat.""Leading garden centres in the UK have been found to be failing to stop the sale of peat in compost, despite pressure from campaigners and government.Last year countryside charity CPRE warned emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reductions  made through new and existing forests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/63D4/production/_121465552_hi071788726.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59195535,science
9,COP26: Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest,"About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.The protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.Greta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.Police arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. Officers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.However the force said the day passed ""largely without incident"". The ""Global Day of Action for Climate Justice"" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.In London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. The opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""It was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.Away from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"".  He tweeted: ""Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.""We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.""Police Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. A spokesperson said: ""We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.""After the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been ""generally good natured"", with people in ""high spirits"".He confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.He said: ""Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.""Despite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. Flags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.One enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for £3.There was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. Members of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.A helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.One group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.The event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.They were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.One of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.It was summed by a banner which read: ""Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists"".The sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.But the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  World leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.But there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.Countries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. ""This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.""Representatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. Some have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. Marchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.Edinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of ""Pedal on COP26"" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.The cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.Police said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of ""congestion issues"". ""Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,"" a Police Scotland tweet said. Bleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. High winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. Saturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BCBC/production/_121461384_071792390-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59185007,science
10,COP26: Why we marched in Glasgow,"Tens of thousands of people have braved the wet and windy conditions in Glasgow to take part in the biggest mass protest of the COP26 summit.A huge column of activists made its way from Kelvingrove Park to the city centre, and on to a rally on Glasgow Green. Some of them explained why they felt it was so important to be there. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, has travelled to Glasgow from Cornwall for the rally. The 46-year-old said: ""The ocean is front and centre of the impact of climate change but it is also part of the solution.""He said the charity's supporters were taking part in events across the country to highlight the impact of human and plastic waste. He added: "" I think campaigners are having an effect and I believe the next decade will be the most radical period of environmental action the world has ever seen.""Retired designer Charlie Rohan travelled from Edinburgh to take part in the march. He made his own sign for the occasion but as the rain lashed down he admitted: ""The cardboard is getting heavier by the minute.""Asked why he made the journey, the father-of-two said: ""This is our last chance. If we don't take action now then COP 27, 28 and 29 will be a waste of time.""The 61-year-old is a keen walker and expressed dismay at the amount of rubbish he encounters washed up on Scotland's coastlines. He added: ""The UK says it is a leader on climate change but we need to follow that through.""Ruby Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people in India. She said: ""When you look at climate change the most vulnerable people will be the most impacted. ""Indigenous people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. ""The consequences are devastating.""The London-based student was joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival International. The group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who face persecution and displacement.She said: ""We have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels.""And we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.""Amalen S has travelled to Glasgow from Malaysia with Friends Of The Earth International, campaigning against carbon markets.To illustrate their point they have built a large ""carbon unicorn"" head - Amalen tells the BBC it emits smoke when up and running.""Carbon market is the same thing as chasing a carbon unicorn, it sounds amazing but it doesn't exist,"" said Amalen.The group has organised a number of demos throughout the summit, including one at the SEC on Friday.Amalen is also part of the Activist Network and his work involves helping people express their views on climate change through artwork.""A lot of lobbying happens behind closed doors,"" he added.Glasgow students Xavier, Ben, Sophie and Abby were giving out flyers for Beyond the Green, an event with live music and speakers promoting sustainability and the use of hemp during COP26.Ben, who studies sound production, said: ""Its a great material to use instead of non-biodegradeables. It can be used to create anything from houses, rope, clothes and food.""He added climate change is something he has always thought about, and tried his best to recycle and go ""beyond the bare minimum"" to live sustainably.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

11,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". ""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". ""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

12,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon as the planet can absorb.If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon than their share.One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DE9/production/_121435711_gettyimages-815252586.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59157836,science

Some of them explained why they felt it was so important to be there. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, has travelled to Glasgow from Cornwall for the rally. The 46-year-old said: ""The ocean is front and centre of the impact of climate change but it is also part of the solution.""He said the charity's supporters were taking part in events across the country to highlight the impact of human and plastic waste. He added: "" I think campaigners are having an effect and I believe the next decade will be the most radical period of environmental action the world has ever seen.""Retired designer Charlie Rohan travelled from Edinburgh to take part in the march. He made his own sign for the occasion but as the rain lashed down he admitted: ""The cardboard is getting heavier by the minute.""Asked why he made the journey, the father-of-two said: ""This is our last chance. If we don't take action now then COP 27, 28 and 29 will be a waste of time.""The 61-year-old is a keen walker and expressed dismay at the amount of rubbish he encounters washed up on Scotland's coastlines. He added: ""The UK says it is a leader on climate change but we need to follow that through.""Ruby Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people in India. She said: ""When you look at climate change the most vulnerable people will be the most impacted. ""Indigenous people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. ""The consequences are devastating.""The London-based student was joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival International. The group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who face persecution and displacement.She said: ""We have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels.""And we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.""Amalen S has travelled to Glasgow from Malaysia with Friends Of The Earth International, campaigning against carbon markets.To illustrate their point they have built a large ""carbon unicorn"" head - Amalen tells the BBC it emits smoke when up and running.""Carbon market is the same thing as chasing a carbon unicorn, it sounds amazing but it doesn't exist,"" said Amalen.The group has organised a number of demos throughout the summit, including one at the SEC on Friday.Amalen is also part of the Activist Network and his work involves helping people express their views on climate change through artwork.""A lot of lobbying happens behind closed doors,"" he added.Glasgow students Xavier, Ben, Sophie and Abby were giving out flyers for Beyond the Green, an event with live music and speakers promoting sustainability and the use of hemp during COP26.Ben, who studies sound production, said: ""Its a great material to use instead of non-biodegradeables. It can be used to create anything from houses, rope, clothes and food.""He added climate change is something he has always thought about, and tried his best to recycle and go ""beyond the bare minimum"" to live sustainably.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4340/production/_121461271_surferhugo_bbc.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59191466,science
16,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". ""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". ""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

17,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon as the planet can absorb.If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon than their share.One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DE9/production/_121435711_gettyimages-815252586.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59157836,science
18,COP26: How the world is reacting to the climate summit,"It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.It's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New YorkPresident Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that ""put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as ""isolated holdouts"" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: ""Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.""There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.Go compare. A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are ""positive consequences of global warming"" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.There's no sense here of a climate emergency. Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a ""smooth"" (longer) transition to greener energy.""Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,"" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. ""I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet."" India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, ""India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions"" - a line that many here applauded. The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a ""bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West"". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept ""sledging"" or ""slurs"". And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.""Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,"" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. ""And it was never more on show than this week as he sold ""the Australian Way"" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.""Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A ""terribly messy week"" for the prime minister.The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in São Paulo.Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like São Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. It's not that Brazilians don't care.""People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,"" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. ""What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,"" Ms Cervellini says. And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.""If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,"" she says. ""We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.""Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, ""there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions"".However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed ""persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as ""enough evidence"".But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by ""demonising"" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/48DF/production/_121455681_gettyimages-1228386010.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59036722,science
19,What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?,"Countries are setting out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.They hope to achieve the target of ""net zero"" by 2050, to help slow global warming.Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises ""well below"" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Experts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.Almost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.Carbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. This involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.However, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.It won't be easy. Reaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.Gas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. Reaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.Presenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:The government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.At the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements ""a massive let-down"".More than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.However, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. Russia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. Until recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.US President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. India - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. Some of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.But many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.For instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. But if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.There are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. However, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. And it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1465F/production/_121215538_netzeropromo.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58874518,science
20,Deforestation: Which countries are still cutting down trees?,"World leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.There have been other attempts to protect forests, but has any progress been made? Forests absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a major contributor to global warming - so cutting down trees can have a big impact on climate change.The UN says 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost since 1990. Agriculture is the main reason for this.There have been efforts to protect forests before.In 2014 the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030.Then, in 2017, it set another target to increase forested land by 3% worldwide by 2030.But deforestation continued at ""an alarming rate"", according to a 2019 report, with serious consequences for the fight against climate change.There has been some reforestation, through natural growth or planting, but trees need years to mature before they can fully absorb CO2. Over the past decade 4.7 million hectares of forest were still lost annually - with Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia among the countries worst affected.Some 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, and it plays a vital role in absorbing harmful CO2 that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.After falling steadily since 2004, deforestation in Brazil's Amazon has risen again, according to the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE). It said in 2020 that the deforestation rate was its highest in more than a decade.Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, told the UN that, as of August this year, deforestation in Brazil was down compared with 2020. However, the rate of deforestation is still higher than before he came to office in 2019.And Imazon - a research institute focused on the Amazon - says its data does not show the rate of deforestation slowing down this year.President Bolsonaro has been criticised for ""anti-environment"" policies, such as encouraging agriculture and mining in the Amazon.He has cut the funding for the government agencies that are responsible for prosecuting farmers and loggers who break environmental law. Fines for illegal logging fell by 20% in 2020.Exact figures are not available, but recent studies suggest as much as 94% of deforestation and habitat destruction in Brazil could be illegal.Brazil is not the only country responsible for the deforestation of the Amazon - neighbouring countries, including Bolivia, also contribute.Last year, Bolivia lost almost 300,000 hectares of tropical forest - the fourth-highest in the world.The Congo forest basin is the second-largest rainforest in the world. More than half of it lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo.Environmental campaign group Greenpeace says illegal logging - by both large and small companies - is leading to deforestation. Although the US and EU have banned importing illegal timber, it still gets smuggled outside the country.Other threats include small-scale subsistence agriculture, clearing for charcoal and fuel, urban expansion and mining.In the past five years, the annual loss of primary forest has been nearly half a million hectares, according to Global Forest Watch.President Felix Tshisekedi last month ordered an audit of some of the leases allocated to harvest public forests - including one for more than 1.4 million hectares - amid allegations of corruption. The move was welcomed by campaigners. But earlier this year, the government also announced a plan to lift a ban dating back to 2002 on new logging operations - although it has not yet been implemented.Greenpeace says that would contradict commitments made earlier this year to protect the forest and increase forest cover by 8%.Indonesia has been among the world's top five countries for forest loss for the past two decades.According to data from Global Forest Watch, the country lost 9.75 million hectares of primary forest between 2002 and 2020.President Joko Widodo pledged in 2014 to crack down on deforestation by tackling the main contributor - clearing land for oil palm plantations. Up to 80% of fires were set for this purpose, according to official data.In 2016, a record 929,000 hectares of forest disappeared, but there's been a steady decrease in the rate of deforestation since then.By 2020, the annual loss was down to 270,000 hectares.In 2019, President Widodo issued a three-year moratorium on new forest clearance, covering about 66 million hectares of primary forest and peatland. This was extended indefinitely this year.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12391/production/_121314647_gettyimages-1174358838.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/59136545,science
21,COP26: What's the climate impact of private jets?,"There has been criticism of the number of world leaders and other delegates who have travelled to the COP26 summit in private jets.How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice?Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there.And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades.We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles, known as ""The Beast"", with him in Glasgow. He also had one in Rome on Sunday.FlightRadar24, which tracks flights, has looked at the number of non-commercial flights into Glasgow, Prestwick and Edinburgh airports since 27 October, excluding cargo, regular or local journeys.It has found that there were about 182 such flights, which is about double the total for the previous six days. That excludes some national chartered flights, such as President Biden's plane, Air Force One.Aviation analytics company Cirium told the BBC there was a total of 76 flights involving private jets, or VIP flights, arriving in and around Glasgow in the four days leading up to 1 November.Private jets have also been flying from Glasgow Airport, in Paisley, where they have dropped off passengers, to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, in Ayrshire, where they have been parking - a distance of about 41km.Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport.But this varies considerably depending on size, occupancy levels and efficiency. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights. There are many different models of private jet, but the Cessna Citation XLS - consistently one of the most popular - burns 189 gallons (857 litres) of aviation fuel an hour on average.If we were to consider the journey from Rome to Glasgow on a private jet - a journey that some of the G20 leaders made to get to COP 26 - that would take around two hours and 45 minutes, requiring 2,356 litres of jet fuel. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says 2.52kg of carbon dioxide is emitted for every litre of aviation turbine fuel burned. Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.However, BEIS recommends that to ""capture the maximum climate impact"" of flights, CO2 emissions figures should be multiplied by 1.9 to reflect the effect of non-CO2 emissions released by planes at high altitude, which, scientists say, increase the warming effect. Therefore, the total emissions for this flight would be 11.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and with a capacity of nine, each passenger would be responsible for 1.2 tonnes on their journey.If, however, our world leaders had decided to take a commercial flight from Rome to Glasgow their emissions would have been a quarter of a tonne each. Even though a commercial flight uses more fuel per hour, it is able to fly far more passengers than a private jet and therefore produces fewer emissions per person. ""A huge amount of fuel is used during takeoff and landing of a plane, no matter how many people you have on board. So an already polluting mode of transport (commercial aviation) becomes even worse (with private jets),"" said Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert in decarbonising transport at University of Oxford.In April, US President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit for world leaders, at which some commitments were made.But several have been talking at this summit about the value of meeting in person.The president of Sierra Leone said: ""I have travelled extensively because I have to be there - we're talking about challenges and the environment in Sierra Leone. If I don't come here, how will they know?""UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said face-to-face talks were needed for ""crunch negotiations"" such as this.Another question being asked on social media is why the meeting of the G20 that happened right before COP26 had to be in Rome.The G20 is a group of big economies plus the European Union. It has a summit once a year, hosted by whichever country is holding the rotating presidency of the group.If COP26 had been in November 2020, as originally planned, it would have been followed by the G20 summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Update 3 November: The piece has been amended to change US gallons to UK gallons in the example of the Cessna plane.Read more about the COP26 summit here.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

22,Leonardo DiCaprio brings star power to Glasgow for COP26,"Actor and environmental campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio has arrived in Glasgow for the COP26 summit.The Hollywood star, who is a UN climate change representative, was seen at the Kew Carbon Garden exhibit on Tuesday at the main conference centre.He was mobbed by journalists, fans and delegates as he entered the building.The Titanic star also took part in a fringe event on Monday, posing with film producer Paul Goodenough, founder of charity Rewriting Extinction.Glaswegians expressed mock surprise at sightings of the Hollywood superstar and other famous faces, with one local tweeting: ""President of the USA outside Greggs and Leonardo DiCaprio in Maryhill. What is this alternative reality Glasgow is living in at the moment?""The COP26 summit is being attended by leaders from around the world, with 200 countries being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. DiCaprio has donated millions to environmental organisations and backed ventures such as those producing trainers made from natural materials.He also described campaigner Greta Thunberg as a ""leader of our time"" when they met in 2019.At the 2016 Oscars, he made a speech declaring climate change to be ""the most urgent threat facing our entire species"".However, at the time, an article published on Forbes website declared the actor's decadent lifestyle meant his ""carbon footprint is much higher than he thinks.""The actor expressed concern himself about this in his 2016 documentary for National Geographic, Before the Flood.DiCaprio has recently been photographed flying commercially rather than by private jet although it's not known how the actor travelled to Scotland this week.The 46-year-old is best known for hit films including The Revenant, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, The Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island, Inception, The Great Gatsby, Blood Diamond and Django Unchained.Read more about the COP26 summit here.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10857/production/_121317676_leo_getty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59139279,science
23,What is climate change? A really simple guide,"World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. However, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. If nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.Wildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image from Getty Images.

24,Climate change: How do we know it is happening and caused by humans?,"Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change. But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  The average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850. Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century. These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites. Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate.This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere.We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - has risen significantly since 1850.  Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm.Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past.Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic. That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities.There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, the tropics could have become ""dead zones"", too hot for most species to survive.These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Niño.For many years, groups of so-called climate ""sceptics"" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  A key UN report released in 2021 said it ""is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land"". The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image credit: Getty Images.

25,Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint?,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator. The Carbon Neutral Calculator is no longer online, but the methodology behind it can still be accessed.The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only ""blue water"", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.

26,Then and now: Why deforestation is such a hot topic,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. For decades, deforestation has been seen as a leading cause of environmental damage. Now, the full cost that losing our tree cover is having on the world's climate is being realised, and politicians are taking notice.If there was a poster-child of environmental degradation, surely it is deforestation. The removal of trees - for example, through logging or fires - has, for many decades, been listed as one of the main factors behind nature loss and environmental harm. In recent years, the loss of tree cover around the world has also been firmly linked to the increasingly volatile changes to the climate.Plants and trees absorb up to a third of our CO2 emissions from the atmosphere each year. Yet, as we fell vast swathes of primary forests around the globe, we are reducing our planet's ability to lock away, or sequester, the harmful gas that is released from burning fossil fuels.According to the UN, an estimated 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost through conversion to other land uses since 1990 - that is an area roughly equivalent to the size of Libya.However, campaigns to protect forests have had an impact during the past three decades. UN data suggests the rate of deforestation between 2015 and 2020 was an estimated 10 million hectares per year, down from 16 million hectares per year in the 1990s. While the issue of deforestation is taken very seriously at a global level, the implementation of strategies and policies to reduce deforestation ultimately rests with national governments.At this level, the track record is much more patchy. For example, Brazil - for a succession of governments - seemed to be heeding international advice and deforestation rates had been falling steadily since 2004.However, scientists writing in Nature journal last year listed the Brazilian Amazon deforestation rate for the previous 12 months as the highest in a decade.Campaigners said the deforestation rate had accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil's president in 2019. They said Mr Bolsonaro's policy of favouring agriculture and mining within the Amazon rainforest was to blame. It illustrates that international efforts to protect these valuable habitats are meaningless unless there is support from national governments.In recent years, trees have become a well-trodden solution for policymakers grappling with the threat posed by climate change.The ability of trees to sequester carbon is a very popular topic within the political arena. They are a well-known facet of the global carbon cycle, removing millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.Therefore, policies that promote and encourage the planting of hundreds of thousands of trees are billed as a vital part of the shift to sustainability, and a key part of the solutions-based approach to tackling the climate crisis facing the planet.However, there are a number of potential hurdles or limitations.Firstly, can we be sure that we are planting more trees than we are losing? Are the new saplings being offered enough protection to ensure they make it to being mature specimens? It is only once that a tree reaches maturity so that it can fully absorb CO2 - on average, about 21kg each year.What species are being planted to sequester carbon? Are they fast-growing or slow-growing? How long do they live? What happens when they die? Will the timber be used for materials and construction or will it be left to rot, releasing the carbon it had locked away from the atmosphere?It has also been identified in a number of studies in urban areas that tree planting schemes are struggling to keep up with the number of trees felled in the name of development.Secondly, as only mature trees can make a meaningful contribution to sequestering carbon, it will take many decades for a sapling to reach maturity. Therefore, the trees we are planting today will only be making a meaningful difference to the volume of CO2 in our atmosphere in half a century's time.A famous Chinese saying suggests that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.However, it adds, the second best time is today - so there is still hope.As another popular saying states: better late than never.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/ED5C/production/_115746706_optimised-amazongdp-nc.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58399809,science
27,Then and now: Pandemic clears the air,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Air pollution has long been one of the biggest killers, claiming an estimated seven million victims annually. However, the Covid-19 global pandemic showed how quickly we could clear the air once we cut the number of journeys we made...Air pollution has long been one of the most severe forms of environmental damage.Figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that air pollution kills seven million people worldwide every year. Its data also shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits on high levels of pollutants.Law-change call after girl dies from air pollution How air pollution exacerbates Covid-19Lockdown prompts clear fall in UK air pollutionEmissions from fuel combustion account for almost a quarter of CO2 emissions from human activities.So the impact of lockdowns on transport around the globe in the Covid-19 pandemic has been stark.According to the International Energy Agency, average activity on the world's roads fell by almost 50% compared with 2019.The improvement in air quality was clear to see. In a short space of time, urban areas were recording massive reductions in a range of pollutants associated with internal combustion engines.Data collected by the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science shows marked reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and in particulate matter (PM2.5) across 10 cities.In India, people took to social media to post images of clear skies after an estimated 90% of road journeys stopped during the lockdown.Speaking in April, Sunil Dahiya from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air told BBC News: ""The current crisis has shown us that clear skies and breathable air can be achieved very fast if concrete action is taken to reduce burning of fossil fuels."" However, as quickly as air quality improved during lockdowns, so it appears to have returned to normal just as fast once lockdowns were eased or lifted.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the global response to the Covid-19 crisis has had little impact on the continued rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO2.Carbon emissions did fall dramatically as lockdowns cut transport and industry sharply.But data from the WMO showed that it had only marginally slowed the overall rise in concentrations.The details were published in the WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin.During the lockdowns, there were widespread calls for the environmental benefits to be maintained. Proponents said it was essential that economic growth after the pandemic focused on following a low emission, sustainable path.Despite calls to build back greener, it seems as if the priority has been business as usual, regardless of cost.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/30732/assets/app-project-assets/airqualityindia_smog_clear_after800.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57149747,science
28,Then and now: A 'megadrought' in California,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of extreme weather on a crucial reservoir that supplies water to millions of people in northern California.This year is likely to be critically dry for California. Winter storms that dumped heavy snow and rain across the state are not expected to be substantial enough to counterbalance drought conditions.Lake Oroville plays a key role in California's complex water delivery system. This 65km-square body of water north of Sacramento is the second-largest reservoir in California.Not only does Lake Oroville store water, it helps control flooding elsewhere in the region, assists with the maintenance of water quality and boosts the health of fisheries downstream.In 2014, more than 80% of California was in the grip of an ""extreme drought"". Against this backdrop, Oroville's capacity fell to 30% - a historic low level.As the water level receded to hundreds of feet below normal levels, ramps and roads no longer reached the water's edge.More worryingly, the reservoir - when full - provided enough water for an estimated seven million households, as well as providing power for hydroelectricity facilities and irrigation for agricultural land.The dry conditions didn't start in 2014, however, there had been a drought for years prior to Oroville recording its historic low level.Indeed, the US space agency's Earth Observatory had warned that the multi-year drought was having a wider impact on the region. Among its effects was a contribution to ""unusually active and destructive"" fire seasons and poor yields from agricultural land.""There is strong evidence from climate models and centuries of tree ring data that suggest about one-third to one-half of the severity of the current drought can be attributed to climate change,"" observed Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist from Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.Agency scientists added that the data suggested a ""megadrought"" might already be underway in this region - and that it could last for decades. The latest update from the US Drought Monitor in December 2020, showed that much of the country's western states were gripped by extreme or exceptional drought, with Nevada, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, Colorado and western Texas being the worst affected.The Drought Monitor releases maps showing the parts of the country with prolonged shortages in the water supply. It is produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).Climate change is not just about a warmer world, it also means that the planet will see more extreme environmental conditions and weather. So, for example, episodes of flooding will increase, as well as episodes of droughts.Lake Oroville was a perfect illustration of how these extremes can threaten our existing infrastructure.While the lake's levels reached a historic low in 2014, the reservoir's vast embankment dam - the tallest in the US - was pushed to breaking point in February 2017.Following fierce storms in the surrounding mountains, water was flowing into the lake at a rate of roughly one-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools each second.Communities downstream had been evacuated, with more than 100,000 people being ordered to leave their homes.Officials were struggling to allow water to flow out of the lake because the main spillway - a structure that provides controlled releases of water - and the emergency spillway had been eroded and damaged. Yet they had to continue sending water down the valley because the reservoir was reaching capacity and there was a sense that there could be a ""catastrophic failure"" in the structure.In the space of two years, the lake went from an unprecedented low to a capacity that had not been experienced before. Water cascaded over the emergency spillways, which had not previously been required.Traditionally, the lake was replenished by meltwater from a thawing snowpack in surrounding mountains, whose river systems fed the reservoir. June was the month when the reservoir was expected to reach its yearly maximum level.However, in 2017, it was rain that caused the intense water flow. The reservoir had reached capacity in February, rather than the middle of the year, as usually happened.Scientists again suggested that the event fitted into the paradigm of a warming world.Speaking at the time to the Guardian newspaper, Prof Roger Bale, from the University of California Merced, explained: ""With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.""The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that the ""frequency and intensity of droughts, storms and extreme weather events are increasingly likely above 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels)"".Failure to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5C, as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is likely to result in more of the world's reservoirs or flood defences being tested to breaking point.This is a stark warning for world leaders, who will be gathering once again this year at the UN's annual climate summit (COP26) - to be held in Glasgow. The meeting, which had to be postponed by a year because of Covid, will seek to raise global ambition on tackling climate change - with a view to keeping temperature rise within the 1.5C limit.Our Planet Then and Now will continue up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is due to start in November 2021",https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/29194-slider-us-drought/assets/app-project-assets/img/bidwell_2014_v2.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56225862,science
29,Then and now: When silence descended over Victoria Falls,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of global heating on Victoria Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world - and how Sub-Saharan Africa is learning to cope with the climate crisis.In full flow, Victoria Falls easily qualifies as one of the natural wonders of the world. Spanning 1.7km at its widest point and with a height of more than 100m, locals refer to Africa's greatest waterfall as ""the smoke that thunders"".This amazing feature is formed as the Zambezi river plunges into a chasm called the First Gorge. The chasm was carved by the action of water along a natural fracture zone in the volcanic rock that makes up the landscape in this region of southern Africa.In 2019, however, Victoria Falls was silenced.In a drought described as the worst in a century, the flow of the Zambezi was reduced to a relative trickle and the Falls ran dry.As one of the region's biggest attractions for tourists, Victoria Falls is a valuable source of income for Zimbabwe and Zambia. As news of the low waters spread, local traders noticed a visible drop in tourist numbers.As well as hitting the countries' economies, it also hit electricity supplies, which are dependent on hydroelectric generation.More widely across the region, agencies reported an increase in the need for food aid, as crops failed in the drought.A single extreme weather event cannot, in isolation, be viewed as a consequence of climate change. But the region is recording a sequence of extreme droughts that reflect what climate modellers have predicted will occur as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere as a result of human activity.Zambia's President, Edgar Lungu - speaking at the time - called it ""a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment"".Observers of weather patterns in the Zambezi Basin believe the changing climate is resulting in a delay to the monsoon season, concentrating the rains into bigger, more intense events. This makes the storage of the water in the region more difficult, and makes the impact of the extended dry season more damaging to people and the environment.The UN's State of the Climate in Africa in 2019 report painted a worrying picture for a continent that could see its population double over the coming century.Speaking at the report's launch in October 2020, World Meteorological Organization secretary-general Petteri Taalas observed: ""Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent, hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources.""In recent months, we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert locusts and now face the looming spectre of drought because of a La Niña event.""The report adds that 2019 was among the three warmest years on record for the continent. It warns that the warming trend is expected to continue. The worrying fact facing politicians, policymakers and civil society is that the continent is set to be hardest hit by climate change, yet the continent's capacity to adapt to the realities of a warming world are low.Areas of concern include water supplies, health, food security, droughts and floods, biodiversity. It is a list of concerns that is continuing to grow.Africa is on the front line of the battle against dangerous climate change.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/30118/assets/app-project-assets/image_slider_victoria_falls_after.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56902340,science
30,Then and now: Arctic sea-ice feeling the heat,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. The shrinking sea-ice in the Arctic is not only a sign of climate change, it is causing the planet to warm more quickly. This is because more sunlight is being absorbed by the darker ocean, rather than being reflected back into space.Arctic sea-ice plays an important role in controlling the planet's temperature, and any problem with this natural thermostat is a cause for concern.Figures from the US space agency (Nasa) suggest the loss of the minimum Arctic sea-ice extent is in the region of 13.1% per decade, based on the 1981 to 2010 average.A major report on climate change in 2007 linked the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused by human activity, with declining sea-ice extent in the region.The disappearance of the sea-ice in a warming world also contributes to rising average surface temperatures. The sea-ice is estimated to reflect 80% of sunlight back into space, meaning it does not warm the surface. But when the sea-ice has melted, the darker ocean surface is exposed, which absorbs about 90% of the sunlight hitting it. This results in warming of the region.This phenomenon is known as the Albedo effect, and it occurs because light surfaces reflect more heat than dark surfaces.The freezing and thawing of the ocean in the Arctic is a seasonal occurrence, with the freezing peaking in March and the melting reaching its maximum in September. However, data from on-the-ground observations and from satellites tell us that the extent of sea-ice in the Arctic polar region is declining as the planet warms.As this occurs, the albedo (or reflectivity) is reduced, because the dark ocean waters absorb more heat than the lighter sea-ice. This in turn causes the land and oceans to warm even more. Ultimately, scientists fear, the increasing amount of ground being exposed in regions traditionally covered with snow will trigger a ""tipping point"". This is where the warming of the atmosphere reaches a point where human interventions will no longer be able to halt it.Another impact of the decreasing density of ice in the northern polar region is the opening of the Northwest Passage. This trading route links the North Atlantic Ocean with the North Pacific Ocean.Since the 19th Century, there has been clamour to find a navigable route through frozen Arctic waters between Greenland and Canada's Arctic islands.It has long been a deadly pursuit for mariners who braved the frozen seascape. However, some experts estimate that the route will become commercially viable in the near future as the sea-ice retreats in the summer months.For some, it is going to revolutionise the global shipping sector. For others, it is a disaster waiting to happen.Environmental groups fear a growing volume of shipping traffic through the pristine Arctic waters will damage slow-growing, long-lived marine ecosystems.They particularly fear a ship encountering a mishap in the remote polar waters, resulting in a potentially devastating pollution incident.Evidence suggests that the thinning sea-ice is affecting wildlife, including top-of-the-food-chain predators such as polar bears. The ice is not strong enough to support the animals' weight, forcing them to embark on energy-sapping swims and making it more difficult to catch prey. As well as causing starvation, it is also reportedly resulting in bears coming into human settlements looking for food.Another concern among scientists is that melting sea-ice is affecting a major ocean current in the Arctic - the Beaufort Gyre. Freshwater is less dense than salty seawater. The researchers said a sudden influx of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean into the northern Atlantic Ocean could alter the strength of the current. This is because the force pushing water down the eastern coast of continental North America will be reduced, resulting in a smaller volume of warmer tropic waters from equatorial regions being displaced towards western Europe. Models suggest the reduction in warmer waters heading towards western Europe will result in lower temperatures in the region. This, in turn, would also affect weather patterns in the global climate system.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10CF/production/_119130340_leads_seaice_small.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57650226,science
31,Astroworld: Victims named as police probe US festival crush,"Family and friends have been paying tribute to those who died following a crowd surge at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas.At least eight people were killed and hundreds hurt at the music event, which is now under investigation by police. Scott has said he is working to help the families of ""the ones that was lost"" after the crowd pressed forward while he was on stage on Friday night.Most of the victims were young people, with the youngest said to be just 14.The family of one victim, 16-year-old Brianna Rodriguez, spoke of their ""profound sadness"" and said the passionate dancer was ""dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"".Earlier, Houston police said their investigation into the crush would include looking into reports that somebody in the audience had been injecting people with drugs.The surge began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday) when panic broke out as the crowd pressed towards the front of the stage during the rapper's headline set.As the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises. On Sunday, GoFund Me pages and emotional social media tributes to those who died were widely shared online. Danish Baig was 27. His brother Basil Mirza Baig posted on Facebook that he had been killed while trying to save another relative in the crush. ""His smile would light up a room"", he wrote. Rudy Peña, from Laredo, Texas, also died in the tragedy. His age has not yet been confirmed. His sister told the Laredo Morning Times that he was ""the sweetest person, friendly, outgoing, he had many friends because he was always there for everyone... he was a big fan of Travis, he loved his music.""Franco Patino, 21, was an engineering student at the University of Dayton. His university confirmed his death to local TV station WHIO. He was also a member of the Alpha Psi Lambda fraternity and completing a work placement in Mason, Ohio. Brianna Rodriguez, 16, was a junior at Heights High School in Houston. ""Dancing was her passion and now she's dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"", her family wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, Houston police Chief Troy Finner said the investigation into the tragedy will include the homicide and narcotics divisions. Teams will review video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. Several concert goers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark.""We do have a report of a security officer... that he was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck,"" Chief Finner said. ""When he was examined he went unconscious,"" he added. ""He was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject.""In his first statement since the event on Twitter, Travis Scott thanked the police and emergency services and said he was ""committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need"".Later he posted a video message on Instagram, in which he encouraged anyone with information about the incident to contact the authorities.Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child - and another one on the way - with socialite Kylie Jenner, who was among the 50,000 people at the festival. She posted on Instagram that they were ""broken and devastated.""""I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing"", she wrote. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to a public disorder charge after he was accused of encouraging people to rush the stage at a concert in the US state of Arkansas. According to a local newspaper, Travis Scott also paid nearly $7,000 (£5,186) to two people who said they were injured at the event.Angelica Casas, BBC News, HoustonA makeshift memorial has been set up along some fencing near the entrance to the festival grounds. Ruby Ayala, 19, came to pay tribute with her family. This was Ayala's first music festival. She went with her sister and some friends - and they made new friends among the crowd. One of them was Franco Patino, who had travelled to Texas from out of state. He has now been confirmed as one of the eight victims.""He had told us he would protect us because he had been to concerts like these before,"" Ayala said in tears. ""I thought to myself, 'I'll just stick with him'.""When the commotion began, they thought it was a mosh pit, a popular dance at music events that involves people pushing against others. But then everyone around them started having trouble breathing and it was hard to get out.They soon lost Patino in the crowd.

""It's hard to believe the candles here are also for him.""Ayala's mother, Graciela Martinez, still can't believe her daughters were among the attendees that day. They had called her Friday night right after the festival.""I didn't understand why she was so upset,"" Martinez said, of her daughter's call. ""She forgot to tell me there were people stepping on dead people. It's painful to see that they went through that and there was nothing we (as parents) could do to help them.""Marc Medina, 18, is also back here with his family today.

33,Sudan coup: Protesters tear-gassed at rally in Khartoum,"Sudanese security forces have fired tear gas at protesters who were taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital, Khartoum.Teachers taking part in one protest were detained by the security forces.Overnight demonstrators set up barricades for the first of two days of planned civil disobedience to protest against last month's coup. They are demanding the military government step back and allow a peaceful transition to civilian rule.The demonstrations are happening as Arab League mediators arrive in Khartoum for talks to try to defuse the crisis.The civilian Prime Minister, Abdalla Hamdok, remains under house arrest and is facing pressure from the military to co-operate with them, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports from the capital.Last month, the coup leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the civilian arm of the government's power-sharing agreement, arrested civilian leaders and declared a state of emergency.Disruptions to the internet had left some people unaware of the two-day civil disobedience action but teachers turned out to protest near the education ministry.""We organised a silent stand against the decisions by Burhan outside the ministry of education,"" Mohamed al-Amin, a geography teacher, told AFP news agency.""Police later came and fired tear gas at us though we were simply standing on the streets and carrying banners.""In Khartoum North, security forces patrolled major streets carrying sticks and tear gas grenades, Reuters added.Victims of the military clampdown are being treated in Khartoum's private Royal Care hospital.Muhayed Faisal, an 18-year-old student, was shot twice in the leg during a recent protest. ""I was shot along with nine people. There were no warning shots, they just started to fire. The military… they're like animals. Maybe animals are better.""He's now had three operations on his right leg. ""Our cause didn't change - the military won't rule us,"" he said, as a doctor stroked his foot to test if any sensation had returned.In a nearby bed, a 54-year-old tailor, Yair Mohamed Ali Abdulla, was surrounded by relatives. He'd left his shop to join the protests when the coup took place. He said he was deliberately run over by soldiers in a vehicle near Khartoum's international airport.""After that, five or six people beat me mercilessly with sticks on my back and chest. I just went [to the protest] to ask for freedom, peace, and justice. If the army can't provide that, they should take off their uniforms and let those who can come and take charge,"" he said.Read Andrew's report in full",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A6B4/production/_121467624_tyresgetty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59197250,politics
34,Iraqi PM al-Kadhimi survives drone attack on his home,"Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has said he escaped unhurt after a drone attack on his home inside Baghdad's high-security Green Zone.A drone laden with explosives struck the building, injuring six of his bodyguards in an apparent assassination attempt, officials said.Mr Kadhimi called for ""calm and restraint from everyone"".The attack, which comes after violent unrest over recent election results, was condemned by both the US and Iran. Security sources say three drones were used in the attack, launched from near Republic Bridge on the River Tigris, but two were shot down.No-one has said they carried out the attack, in an area of the city housing many government buildings and foreign embassies.Images published by Iraqi media show damage to parts of the residence as well as an SUV vehicle parked in a garage.Remains of a small explosives-laden drone were collected by security forces for examination, an unnamed security official told Reuters news agency.""It's premature now to say who carried out the attack,"" the official was quoted as saying. ""We're checking our intelligence reports and waiting for initial investigation results to point the finger at perpetrators.""Commercial drones fitted with explosive were used by the Islamic State militant group when it held parts of northern Iraq, notably during the battle for Mosul in 2017.Mr al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief, was sworn into office in May last year.By Anna Foster, BBC Middle East correspondent Iraq held elections less than a month ago, and now it's in the long and awkward process of trying to form a governing coalition. The turnout was a record low - just 41% - and that lack of engagement shows that many Iraqis don't believe any real change lies ahead. Pro-Iranian parties did worse than they'd hoped for, losing many of their seats. Their supporters have been protesting against the results ever since, holding demonstrations outside Baghdad's secure Green Zone and calling for votes to be manually recounted. The Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr claimed victory, as his party gained the most seats. He's pushing for a government free from foreign interference - and crucially that means from Iran as well as the West. He wants to end Tehran's influence over Iraq's internal affairs. These political faultlines mean tensions are high, and this attempt on Prime Minister al-Kadhimi's life could turn out to be a dangerous escalation with far-reaching repercussions.The drone attack was widely condemned: ",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18098/production/_121465489_gettyimages-1229177869.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59195399,politics
35,Italian Mafia: 'Ndrangheta members convicted as Italy begins huge trial,"An Italian court has sentenced 70 members of the powerful mafia group, the 'Ndrangheta, in the first stage of the biggest mafia trial in decades. Defendants faced charges including attempted murder and extortion. Over the next two years, 355 alleged mobsters and corrupt officials will face court for their involvement with Italy's richest and most powerful organised crime group. Hundreds of lawyers and nearly a thousand witnesses are involved.Saturday's ""maxi trials"" took place behind closed doors in a specially converted courtroom in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme. Those accused had opted for a speedy trial which allowed them to have their sentences reduced by a third if found guilty. Judges handed six of those convicted the maximum 20-year sentence that prosecutors had asked for. Another 21 defendants were acquitted.The 'Ndrangheta is a sprawling criminal network consisting of some 150 families. This trial is targeting just one of those: The Mancuso family. The lengthy charge sheet includes an array of drugs charges, murder, attempted murder, extortion, loan sharking, disclosure of official secrets and abuse of office.Alleged boss Luigi Mancuso, 67, who goes by the nickname ""the Uncle"", and ex-senator Giancarlo Pittelli, 68, who prosecutors have alleged was his white-collar fixer, will face longer court trials at a later date. Leading the case is Nicola Gratteri, one of Italy's most respected anti-mafia chief prosecutors. He has spent decades tackling the Italian crime gangs and as a consequence has lived under police protection for more than 30 years. Mr Gratteri vowed earlier this year to take down ""this asphyxiating 'Ndrangheta, which truly takes the breath and the heartbeat from the people"" and told reporters that Saturday's sentencing had ""gone very well"".The 'Ndrangheta rose to prominence after the maxi trials of the late 1980s, which significantly weakened Sicily's Cosa Nostra mafia families. The 'Ndrangheta is involved in a wide range of illegal activities, but it specialises in cocaine trafficking and is believed to control about 80% of Europe's trade.

36,US to reopen borders to vaccinated travellers after 20 months,"The US is reopening its borders on Monday to double-jabbed foreign visitors, ending a 20-month entry ban.The ban was imposed by former President Donald Trump due to Covid-19.It has affected non-US citizens from over 30 countries, including the UK and EU states, separating families and stalling tourism.Airlines are expecting a flood of visitors as the restrictions are lifted for those who are fully vaccinated, and undergo testing and contact tracing.""It feels good, it feels good!"" Jerome Thomann, head of Paris-based travel agency Jetset Voyages told Reuters news agency, saying his team had seen an ""incredible upturn"" in bookings.In an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus, US borders were initially closed to travellers from China in early 2020. The restrictions were then extended to other countries.The rules barred entry to most non-US citizens who had been in the UK and a number of other European countries, as well as China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.Under the new rules, foreign travellers will need to show proof of vaccination before flying, get a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of travelling, and hand over their contact information. They will not have to quarantine.Alison Henry, a 63-year-old British mother, told AFP news agency: ""It's been so hard - I just want to see my son.""Ms Henry, from Cheshire, plans to fly to New York on Monday to see her son for the first time in 20 months.The US land borders with neighbours Canada and Mexico will also reopen for the fully vaccinated.Businesses in cities along the border with Mexico are hoping for a boost after struggling under the restrictions.United Airlines says it expects a 50% rise in international inbound passengers, while Delta's chief executive Ed Bastian warned travellers to expect queues.Mr Bastian said: ""It's going to be a bit sloppy at first. I can assure you, there will be lines unfortunately.""The EU recommended allowing American travellers into the bloc in June, while visitors from the US have been able to travel to the UK since 28 July.

37,Elon Musk holds Twitter vote over $21bn Tesla share sale,"Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has launched a Twitter poll of his 62.6 million followers asking if he should sell 10% of his shares.The vote, which closes later on Sunday, could see him dispose of $21bn (£16bn) of stock in the electric carmaker.He promised to abide by the result of the poll, a response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats.The plan could see Mr Musk, who is one of the world's richest men, face a huge tax bill.By mid-afternoon on Sunday, with about 3 hours to go before the poll closes, 57.2% of the 3.2 million respondents had voted ""yes"".The Tesla chief executive owns more than $200bn worth of shares and is due to exercise options next year that will boost his worth even further, but leave Mr Musk with what he said would be a ""massive"" tax bill.Under plans proposed by the Democratic Party in the Senate, billionaires could be taxed on ""unrealised gains"" when the price of their shares goes up - even if they do not sell any of their stock.In another tweet on Saturday, Mr Musk said: ""Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he tweeted.It is thought the proposed tax on capital gains, whether or not assets have been sold, could hit about 700 billionaires in the US. Critics have pointed out that the value of assets do not always go up.Mr Musk has an option, which expires in August next year, to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each - a fraction of Tesla's closing share price on Friday of $1,222.He recently said that he would sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to the World Food Program, provided the organisation disclosed more information about how it spent its money.The poll has raised some eyebrows in the world of finance. ""We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,"" Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter.""Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,"" Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted.

38,Astroworld: Victims named as police probe US festival crush,"Family and friends have been paying tribute to those who died following a crowd surge at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas.At least eight people were killed and hundreds hurt at the music event, which is now under investigation by police. Scott has said he is working to help the families of ""the ones that was lost"" after the crowd pressed forward while he was on stage on Friday night.Most of the victims were young people, with the youngest said to be just 14.The family of one victim, 16-year-old Brianna Rodriguez, spoke of their ""profound sadness"" and said the passionate dancer was ""dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"".Earlier, Houston police said their investigation into the crush would include looking into reports that somebody in the audience had been injecting people with drugs.The surge began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday) when panic broke out as the crowd pressed towards the front of the stage during the rapper's headline set.As the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises. On Sunday, GoFund Me pages and emotional social media tributes to those who died were widely shared online. Danish Baig was 27. His brother Basil Mirza Baig posted on Facebook that he had been killed while trying to save another relative in the crush. ""His smile would light up a room"", he wrote. Rudy Peña, from Laredo, Texas, also died in the tragedy. His age has not yet been confirmed. His sister told the Laredo Morning Times that he was ""the sweetest person, friendly, outgoing, he had many friends because he was always there for everyone... he was a big fan of Travis, he loved his music.""Franco Patino, 21, was an engineering student at the University of Dayton. His university confirmed his death to local TV station WHIO. He was also a member of the Alpha Psi Lambda fraternity and completing a work placement in Mason, Ohio. Brianna Rodriguez, 16, was a junior at Heights High School in Houston. ""Dancing was her passion and now she's dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"", her family wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, Houston police Chief Troy Finner said the investigation into the tragedy will include the homicide and narcotics divisions. Teams will review video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. Several concert goers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark.""We do have a report of a security officer... that he was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck,"" Chief Finner said. ""When he was examined he went unconscious,"" he added. ""He was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject.""In his first statement since the event on Twitter, Travis Scott thanked the police and emergency services and said he was ""committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need"".Later he posted a video message on Instagram, in which he encouraged anyone with information about the incident to contact the authorities.Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child - and another one on the way - with socialite Kylie Jenner, who was among the 50,000 people at the festival. She posted on Instagram that they were ""broken and devastated.""""I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing"", she wrote. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to a public disorder charge after he was accused of encouraging people to rush the stage at a concert in the US state of Arkansas. According to a local newspaper, Travis Scott also paid nearly $7,000 (£5,186) to two people who said they were injured at the event.Angelica Casas, BBC News, HoustonA makeshift memorial has been set up along some fencing near the entrance to the festival grounds. Ruby Ayala, 19, came to pay tribute with her family. This was Ayala's first music festival. She went with her sister and some friends - and they made new friends among the crowd. One of them was Franco Patino, who had travelled to Texas from out of state. He has now been confirmed as one of the eight victims.""He had told us he would protect us because he had been to concerts like these before,"" Ayala said in tears. ""I thought to myself, 'I'll just stick with him'.""When the commotion began, they thought it was a mosh pit, a popular dance at music events that involves people pushing against others. But then everyone around them started having trouble breathing and it was hard to get out.They soon lost Patino in the crowd. ""If I would have moved over just a little bit, that could have been me.""Standing in front of the memorial, Ayala's younger sister leans in to hug her. ""It's hard to believe the candles here are also for him.""Ayala's mother, Graciela Martinez, still can't believe her daughters were among the attendees that day. They had called her Friday night right after the festival.""I didn't understand why she was so upset,"" Martinez said, of her daughter's call. ""She forgot to tell me there were people stepping on dead people. It's painful to see that they went through that and there was nothing we (as parents) could do to help them.""Marc Medina, 18, is also back here with his family today. He starts remembering how at the concert he passed by a woman needing help. ""There was this girl and she fell…"" He can't bring himself to continue.""It's not easy to come back here,"" he said. ""But you want people to feel remembered and not forgotten.""Did you witness the incident?

39,Sudan coup: Protesters tear-gassed at rally in Khartoum,"Sudanese security forces have fired tear gas at protesters who were taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital, Khartoum.Teachers taking part in one protest were detained by the security forces.Overnight demonstrators set up barricades for the first of two days of planned civil disobedience to protest against last month's coup.

""I was shot along with nine people. There were no warning shots, they just started to fire. The military… they're like animals.

He'd left his shop to join the protests when the coup took place. He said he was deliberately run over by soldiers in a vehicle near Khartoum's international airport.""After that, five or six people beat me mercilessly with sticks on my back and chest.

40,Iraqi PM al-Kadhimi survives drone attack on his home,"Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has said he escaped unhurt after a drone attack on his home inside Baghdad's high-security Green Zone.A drone laden with explosives struck the building, injuring six of his bodyguards in an apparent assassination attempt, officials said.Mr Kadhimi called for ""calm and restraint from everyone"".The attack, which comes after violent unrest over recent election results, was condemned by both the US and Iran. Security sources say three drones were used in the attack, launched from near Republic Bridge on the River Tigris, but two were shot down.No-one has said they carried out the attack, in an area of the city housing many government buildings and foreign embassies.Images published by Iraqi media show damage to parts of the residence as well as an SUV vehicle parked in a garage.Remains of a small explosives-laden drone were collected by security forces for examination, an unnamed security official told Reuters news agency.""It's premature now to say who carried out the attack,"" the official was quoted as saying. ""We're checking our intelligence reports and waiting for initial investigation results to point the finger at perpetrators.""Commercial drones fitted with explosive were used by the Islamic State militant group when it held parts of northern Iraq, notably during the battle for Mosul in 2017.Mr al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief, was sworn into office in May last year.By Anna Foster, BBC Middle East correspondent Iraq held elections less than a month ago, and now it's in the long and awkward process of trying to form a governing coalition. The turnout was a record low - just 41% - and that lack of engagement shows that many Iraqis don't believe any real change lies ahead. Pro-Iranian parties did worse than they'd hoped for, losing many of their seats. Their supporters have been protesting against the results ever since, holding demonstrations outside Baghdad's secure Green Zone and calling for votes to be manually recounted.

41,Italian Mafia: 'Ndrangheta members convicted as Italy begins huge trial,"An Italian court has sentenced 70 members of the powerful mafia group, the 'Ndrangheta, in the first stage of the biggest mafia trial in decades. Defendants faced charges including attempted murder and extortion. Over the next two years, 355 alleged mobsters and corrupt officials will face court for their involvement with Italy's richest and most powerful organised crime group. Hundreds of lawyers and nearly a thousand witnesses are involved.Saturday's ""maxi trials"" took place behind closed doors in a specially converted courtroom in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme. Those accused had opted for a speedy trial which allowed them to have their sentences reduced by a third if found guilty. Judges handed six of those convicted the maximum 20-year sentence that prosecutors had asked for. Another 21 defendants were acquitted.The 'Ndrangheta is a sprawling criminal network consisting of some 150 families. This trial is targeting just one of those: The Mancuso family. The lengthy charge sheet includes an array of drugs charges, murder, attempted murder, extortion, loan sharking, disclosure of official secrets and abuse of office.Alleged boss Luigi Mancuso, 67, who goes by the nickname ""the Uncle"", and ex-senator Giancarlo Pittelli, 68, who prosecutors have alleged was his white-collar fixer, will face longer court trials at a later date. Leading the case is Nicola Gratteri, one of Italy's most respected anti-mafia chief prosecutors. He has spent decades tackling the Italian crime gangs and as a consequence has lived under police protection for more than 30 years. Mr Gratteri vowed earlier this year to take down ""this asphyxiating 'Ndrangheta, which truly takes the breath and the heartbeat from the people"" and told reporters that Saturday's sentencing had ""gone very well"".The 'Ndrangheta rose to prominence after the maxi trials of the late 1980s, which significantly weakened Sicily's Cosa Nostra mafia families. The 'Ndrangheta is involved in a wide range of illegal activities, but it specialises in cocaine trafficking and is believed to control about 80% of Europe's trade.

Critics have pointed out that the value of assets do not always go up.Mr Musk has an option, which expires in August next year, to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each - a fraction of Tesla's closing share price on Friday of $1,222.He recently said that he would sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to the World Food Program, provided the organisation disclosed more information about how it spent its money.The poll has raised some eyebrows in the world of finance. ""We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,"" Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter.""Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,"" Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted.

49,Libya: Row over attempt to suspend foreign minister Najla El-Mangoush,"Libya's presidential council says it has suspended Foreign Minister Najla El-Mangoush for 14 days and banned her from travelling, pending an inquiry.It accused her of not co-ordinating on foreign policy, but the transitional government rejected the decision, saying she would carry on as normal.The political infighting follows comments she made in a BBC interview about the Lockerbie bombing in 1988.Libya admitted responsibility for the bombing in 2003.Controversy ignited here after the minister spoke to the BBC about the possible extradition of a new Libyan suspect wanted by the US over the bombing.The downing of the plane - in which 270 people were killed - remains a sensitive subject here, and a painful one in the US and Britain.Najla El-Mangoush told us that the Libyan government was very open to collaborating with the US on the question of extradition, and said the matter was progressing. ""We understand the pain and sadness of the victims and the families,"" she said.The move to suspend - and ground - the top diplomat comes ahead of a major international conference on Libya in Paris next Friday.It also comes as Libya is moving uncertainly towards nationwide elections, due in late December.This kind of dispute between institutions of state is not new in Libya, far from it. The country has two competing parliaments and is deeply divided between East and West.  With the elections approaching, the internal competition is on the increase.  The Libyan government said the presidential council had no legal authority to suspend or investigate a minister, and the foreign minister would continue her work. She is currently out of the country and is expected to attend the Paris conference.It's likely that the international community will want this row to be defused quickly, to keep the focus on holding elections - tricky as that may be - and on the future of Libya.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/131F4/production/_121442387_1200birdmarket04.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59196814,politics

51,Palma de Mallorca: Fleeing passengers shut down busy Spanish airport,"One of Spain's busiest airports shut down for nearly four hours on Friday after an apparent attempt by migrants to enter the country illegally.A plane flying from Casablanca in Morocco to Istanbul, Turkey, was diverted to Palma de Mallorca after a medical emergency was reported aboard.When the jet landed, 21 passengers ran off across the runways, reportedly escaping over the perimeter fence.  Police later made arrests but 12 were still on the run on Saturday.Police are investigating whether the group's escape from the plane was spontaneous or an elaborate plot to immigrate illegally.The top Spanish government official for the Balearic Islands, Aina Calvo, said the event was unprecedented for a Spanish airport.The drama began when emergency services boarded the Air Arabia Maroc plane to evacuate a Moroccan man said to have fallen into a diabetic coma. As they did so, 21 other passengers ran down the steps and fled, reportedly hiding under parked planes.After a health check at a hospital found him to be fit and well, the Moroccan man was discharged and arrested for illegally entering the country, Spain's Efe news agency reports. A fellow passenger accompanying him to the hospital reportedly disappeared.Most of the escapees who were arrested were found by the Guardia Civil, the Majorca Daily Bulletin reports, noting that ""one was caught walking along the road to Manacor"".  The total number involved was 24, including a person arrested for aggressive behaviour on the plane.Some 60 national and international flights were diverted or delayed as a result of the incident.The Air Arabia Maroc plane later continued to Turkey with its remaining passengers.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6FD2/production/_121462682_mediaitem121462680.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59191108,politics
52,Harvey Milk: US Navy launches ship named for gay rights leader,"The US Navy has launched a ship named after a gay rights activist forced to resign from the service because of his sexuality in the 1950s. The USNS Harvey Milk was launched in San Diego on Saturday in a service attended by Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Milk's nephew, Stuart. It is one of six new ships to be named after famed US civil rights leaders.Others include former Chief Justice Earl Warren and slain presidential candidate Robert Kennedy.Milk served as a diving officer and Lieutenant aboard the submarine rescue ship USS Kittiwake during the Korean War. But he was forced out of the service following two weeks of interrogation about his sexuality in 1955.He later became one of America's first openly gay politicians, elected in 1977 to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.But a year later he was shot and killed by Dan White, a former city supervisor with whom he had frequently clashed.Speaking at the ceremony, Secretary Del Toro said that it had been wrong that Milk had been forced to ""mask that very important part of his life"" during his time in the Navy.""For far too long, sailors like Lt. Milk were forced into the shadows or, worse yet, forced out of our beloved Navy,"" Del Toro said. ""That injustice is part of our Navy history, but so is the perseverance of all who continue to serve in the face of injustice."" When the Obama administration first announced its intention to name a ship after Milk in 2016 some expressed opposition to the move.  They suggested that Milk would have disapproved of lending his name to a Navy ship given his well known opposition to the Vietnam War.

53,Nicaragua's Ortega courts isolation with one-sided vote,"Nicaragua's left-wing president, Daniel Ortega, is currently the longest-serving leader in the Americas. On Sunday, he looks set to extend his rule for five more years in a one-sided election dismissed as an illegitimate ""farce"" by his main opponents and by most democratic governments.The 75-year-old former Marxist guerrilla commander is seeking re-election for a fourth consecutive term.He has governed the Central American nation for over half of the more than four decades since Nicaragua's 1979 Revolution that toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza.After quashing anti-government protests that defied his Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) government in 2018, President Ortega outraged the US, its allies in Latin America and the EU by brazenly sidelining his main opposition election challengers. They were detained and disqualified from standing for office or forced into exile. Dozens of other members of the opposition were also arrested.This crackdown in the months leading up to Sunday's vote means that the re-election of President Ortega and his wife, Vice-President Rosario Murillo, is viewed by critics and supporters alike as virtually a foregone conclusion.A number of other, little-known presidential candidates will also be on the ballot but are unlikely to attract many votes.The US and EU have signalled likely further diplomatic isolation and sanctions in the event of a another win by Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo. The couple in turn regularly denounce ""imperialist"" US threats against Nicaragua.Nicaragua's army, which is viewed as loyal to President Ortega along with the police, has announced the deployment of 15,000 troops around the country to provide ""security"" for the vote.Since the 2018 protests were put down by the security forces, major anti-government demonstrations have been rare and many opposition figures have fled into exile.Some voters may heed opposition calls for a boycott of the elections. Opposition civil society organisations and student groups have called for an ""electoral strike"".The opposition's main presidential candidates - Cristiana Chamorro, Arturo Cruz, Félix Maradiaga, Juan Sebastián Chamorro, Miguel Mora, Medardo Mairena and Noel Vidaurre - were swept out of contention by being variously detained, restricted, barred and forced into exile in mid-2021 under a phalanx of ""anti-terrorist"" and ""defence of national sovereignty"" laws.  A major opposition grouping, the Citizens for Liberty, had its legal status cancelled.The candidates who have been allowed to stand are being dismissed by opposition commentators and media as ""collaborationists"" in an ""electoral farce"".According to a recent survey by Costa Rican pollster CID Gallup, at least 76% of Nicaraguans considered that the re-election of Mr Ortega would be ""illegitimate"" or of ""little legitimacy"". Nevertheless, the same poll had 55% of respondents saying they had ""a lot of"" or ""some interest"" in voting, whereas 44% had ""little or no intention"".The network of media controlled by Mr Ortega's government and his family has maintained a barrage of upbeat coverage of the 7 November elections, calling them ""democratic"" and ""transparent"". The barred opposition contenders and detained opponents have been regularly portrayed by the government narrative as US-backed ""terrorists"" seeking to sow ""hatred"" and disorder.On the opposition side, politicians and commentators, some of them in exile, have kept up a steady drumbeat of condemnation, criticism and rejection of the elections.Pro-opposition media have been reporting that various sectors, including government workers and public school teachers, were being forced with threats to vote for the governing party.There has also been criticism from members of the Catholic Church, which maintains influence in Nicaragua and has reprimanded the Ortega government in the past for anti-democratic abuses. Pro-opposition daily La Prensa cited one parish priest, Uriel Vallejos, as saying in a homily that he would not vote and that ""the people are going to turn their back on the dictatorship"".The US government, the Organization of American States and the EU have all been adamant in their view that the 7 November elections cannot be considered valid.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told journalists this week that he viewed the Nicaragua vote as ""a complete fake"", from which there could be no ""legitimate result"".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused Mr Ortega and Ms Murillo of ""preparing a false election that is lacking credibility"".EU foreign ministers have asked Mr Borrell to prepare additional sanctions against the Nicaraguan government and its officials. Vice-President Murillo and the couple's sons, as well as other top Sandinista officials, have already been targeted by US and EU sanctions.Nevertheless, President Ortega and his FSLN party can still count on the support of like-minded anti-US governments in Cuba, Venezuela and Russia, among others.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0B93/production/_121436920_c5137c86-2418-4965-9667-401a03e9820a.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-59167119,politics
54,Sudan coup protesters: 'They cannot kill us all',"A fortnight after Sudan's turbulent transition to democracy was hijacked by a military coup, the streets of the capital, Khartoum, remain clogged with makeshift barricades. In most places, the bricks and burnt tyres have now been pulled back to allow traffic to pass - as neighbourhoods wait to see if tense, behind-the-scenes political negotiations can unravel the coup.But there is a widespread belief here that the roadblocks, the protests, and the army's violent response, could flare up at any moment.""There is no way out but dialogue and negotiation,"" said Suleima Elkhalifa, who headed a unit in the transitional government tasked with protecting women and children from violence. ""But people are more determined now. And more politically aware. After 30 years of military dictatorship, we will not submit. The youth represent more than 50% of this country and it's clear we don't want this government. They cannot kill us all. They cannot kill this dream,"" she said.There appears to be broad support for Abdalla Hamdok, the transitional prime minister who was detained by the military during the coup and remains under a form of house arrest. ""Hamdok proved to be a man of his word - that's why people trust him [despite economic hardship],"" said Ms Elkhalifa. ""We hope that Egypt, the Saudis, and others change their minds,"" she added, referring to countries widely believed to be supportive of the coup. In Khartoum's private Royal Care hospital, victims of the military clampdown that followed the coup shared the same determination. Muhayed Faisal, an 18-year-old student, was shot twice in the leg during a recent protest.""I was shot along with nine people. There were no warning shots, they just started to fire. The military… they're like animals. Maybe animals are better."" He's now had three operations on his right leg. ""Our cause didn't change - the military won't rule us,"" he said, as a doctor stroked his foot to test if any sensation had returned.In a nearby bed, a 54-year-old tailor, Yair Mohamed Ali Abdulla, was surrounded by relatives. He'd left his shop to join the protests when the coup took place. He said he was deliberately run over by soldiers in a vehicle near Khartoum's international airport. ""After that, five or six people beat me mercilessly with sticks on my back and chest. I just went [to the protest] to ask for freedom, peace, and justice. If the army can't provide that, they should take off their uniforms and let those who can come and take charge,"" he said.There is speculation about the shape and fate of a possible deal between the military and the various parties and organisations involved in the transitional government that emerged from Sudan's 2019 popular revolution against long-standing leader Omar al-Bashir. But diplomatic and other sources in Khartoum declined to comment, citing the precarious nature of those negotiations, which are taking place under intense international pressure. Coup leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has said the army stepped in to avoid a civil war.His spokesman retired Admiral Fateh al-Rahman told the BBC: ""Time will show that this wasn't a coup. We will put a civilian government back in place and hold elections. Then the military will step aside completely.""One institution that was immediately shut down by the military following the coup was the transitional government's Dismantling Committee - an organisation created to seize economic assets allegedly stolen by powerful figures in the old regime.A few months before the coup, one of the committee's senior officials, Wajdi Saleh, gave the BBC a tour of the unit, showing piles of what he said was incriminating evidence.""These were people who organised some of the largest money-laundering operations on the planet. We are now hunting the missing billions. The old regime is trying [to thwart the revolution] but they will never succeed,"" he said. He was arrested during the coup, and remains in detention, along with many other influential figures in the transitional government.""It is widely believed that recent investigations by the Dismantling Committee were causing unease among the military top brass. The committee is tracing various cases from gold smuggling to currency sales and commissions, all indicating high levels of corruption among high-ranking officers,"" said Mohanad Hashim, a former BBC journalist who had been working since the revolution for Sudan's state television.Admiral al-Rahman said the committee had been ""using the law to create a new form of corruption"". ""Those who stole must be held accountable. But it must be a just process.""The blockade of a key port has been lifted since the coup - indeed it is widely suspected that the military organised the blockade to pile economic pressure on the transitional government. The result has been more food supplies and some lower prices in Khartoum. But although the coup plotters appear to have prepared the ground for their action with some care, they appear to have misread the ""street"" which appears resolute in defending the revolution despite the economic hardships that have followed in its wake.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8D14/production/_121461163_sudangetty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59174642,politics
55,The Rotterdam museum set to display its entire art collection,"Sunbeams rebound off a mirrored facade, abseilers perform stunts on the imposing 40m-high cauldron-shaped sculpture.This is The Depot in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, which opens to the public on Saturday after a royal unveiling by King Willem-Alexander.Most museums have capacity to display only a small percentage of their works.The Depot is exhibiting the Boijmans Van Beuningen's entire art collection of more than 150,000 pieces.Other European museums have been in touch, investigating how they might share their storage in ambitious, previously unseen ways.In reflecting Rotterdam's skyline in the soaring curved exterior, the idea is that as people look at The Depot they see themselves.It is a thematic ambition that continues inside.As we soar skywards in a glass elevator, I spot Picasso's Grey Owl and a bejewelled carpet by Dutch artist Suzan Drummen: ancient artefacts jostling for attention with contemporary treasures.An eclectic collection is visible from the six-storey atrium. Traversing, transparent staircases encourage visitors to explore beyond their comfort zones and discover new realms.In traditional galleries, the main attractions occupy prime position in great halls.In the Rijksmuseum, Louvre or Prado, enthusiasts might make a beeline for The Night Watch, Mona Lisa or Hieronymus Bosch, the pragmatic layout of The Depot forces visitors to change their behaviour.The collection is worth an estimated $8bn (£6bn), but works here are arranged according to type and size, rather than value or status.The hierarchy has been deliberately dismantled.Away from the atrium in storage areas white coats must be worn. We tread over white sticky plastic mats, designed to prise off any bugs and dirt to protect and preserve.Paintings are hung on retractable ceiling-to-floor white wire racks, attached to rails. They can be pulled out, but strictly by museum staff only, to reveal the works of some of the world's most revered masters.Seeing these old masters in a new light invites the audience to appreciate art as we see it, rather than from a prescribed or preconceived perspective.The idea is to make this space more inviting for those intimidated by monumental museums.Gasps resound as a ceiling-height Salvador Dalí is hauled out from the racks like a library book, it is breath-taking to see such masterpieces slung almost like objects displayed in a Swedish furniture store.""We are as safe as the national bank; we have to be,"" Ina Klaassen, one of the museum's directors, assures me. Not even the directors have the biometric credentials required to access the secure zones within this priceless collection.Putting the backstage front-stage is a means to celebrate the importance of curating to contemporary culture.Restoration and conservation work is conducted in public view as staff peer through microscopes. Rotterdam's cityscape provides a dramatic backdrop, transforming behind-the-scenes procedures into almost theatrical displays.  Sometimes it's hard to differentiate between art and life and where the boundary lies.Engineers hang upside down, housekeepers in shimmering jumpers lug vacuum cleaners alongside us in the lift.The interior, industrial concrete is in keeping with the concept of this being a work space and a practical solution to the challenges of storing such vast public collections previously vulnerable to floods.The original museum here had to be shut after suffering years of flooding and it could anyway only show a small proportion of the objects.With a focus on sustainability, the building's toilets are flushed with rainwater collected on the roof, where elm trees are thriving. It is emblematic of a space that wants to blend in with the local environment as much as it aspires to stand out.The Depot's answer to the problem of exhibiting and storing all of a museum's works has given the art world a valuable precedent.In 2023 London's Victoria and Albert Museum will open the V&A East Storehouse on the former 2012 Olympic site, taking visitors behind the scenes in an ""immersive experience"". But Ina Klaassen believes The Depot will remain one of a kind. ""We had the space and idea to do it in a really radical way, I don't think anyone can do it like this.""All images by Anna Holligan subject to copyright",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/20BF/production/_121438380_thumbnail_img_7956.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59168993,politics
56,Paris attacks trial: Humdrum lives that turned to mass murder,"They had happy childhoods in Brussels, Malmo or Tunis, with plenty of brothers and sisters and parents who worked hard to give them life's comforts.The long-running Paris attacks trial heard this week how the once ordinary lives of 14 men in the dock became a mix of petty jobs and petty crime. Some went to join the war in Syria, and then became caught up in an Islamic State vengeance plot to wreak terrorist havoc in Western Europe.It culminated in the murder of 130 people on the night of 13 November 2015.This is the moment in major trials in France when prosecutors and lawyers get a chance to look into the private, working - and criminal - lives of defendants. Questions on the actual charges or the men's religious beliefs were excluded by the presiding judge until January.After weeks of painful eyewitness accounts, it is the first time since the trial began in September that the spotlight has been on the accused, and their voices help build a picture of the world from which they emerged.A key place in this world was the Molenbeek neighbourhood of Brussels, and in particular the Les Béguines café there, run by Brahim Abdeslam. Brahim Abdeslam was one of the café terrace gunmen in November 2015. He blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire. He was also the brother of Salah Abdeslam, the alleged ""10th man"" in the Paris attacks and best-known of the defendants. Speaking of his childhood on Tuesday, Salah Abdeslam, 32, cut a different figure from the aggressively unrepentant side that he has shown so far in the trial. He even raised a few mild laughs in the courtroom. Born in Brussels to Moroccan parents, and with French nationality, he described himself as ""quiet - a nice guy"". ""I was popular with the teachers… good in certain subjects. I studied hard. I gave my all. I was ambitious."" He took a diploma in electrical mechanics and started work, like his father, at the Brussels tram company. But after a year and a half he was fired.""Why were you fired?"" asked the presiding judge. ""Because I was in prison.""At the end of 2010, Salah Abdeslam had taken part in a botched robbery with his friend Abdelhamid Abaaoud - the same Abaaoud who would become the ringleader of the Paris attacks. ""I was born and grew up in Belgium. I went to state school. I lived as I was taught to live in the West. Like everyone else, I wanted to marry and have children,"" he told the court. ""But I put all that to one side the moment I decided to invest myself in another project."" What other project, asked the judge. ""The things I am accused of now."" Another habitué of Les Béguines in Molenbeek was Mohamed Abrini, 36. He is accused of ferrying the Paris jihadists from Brussels on the eve of the attacks. He is also believed to be the ""man in the hat"" who failed to blow himself up in the deadly attack on Brussels airport in March 2016. One of seven children of a Moroccan-born builder who ""earned a good wage - we were neither rich nor poor"",  he had a first conviction (of six) at 17 for stealing a car.   Then came a succession of odd jobs, but he was also a compulsive gambler. He planned to marry, but when a younger brother was killed in Syria, he vowed to go there too. ""Did you not wish to repay your parents for their love and encouragement?"" asked the judge. ""Naturally they were disappointed. I'd have liked to make my father proud. Our parents did all they could to make sure we succeeded in life. I was dragged down by the neighbourhood."" ""And yet your elder brother, who also grew up there - he did well in life.""""If you add up those who failed and those who succeeded, it's about 80-20. I am one of those who did not make a success."" Hamza Attou, 27, also frequented Les Béguines.  The youngest of six children born to Belgian-Moroccan parents, he said he had a good childhood but after leaving school developed a cannabis habit. To pay for it, he began to deal. ""That's how I lived. I sold cannabis resin. I know it's an offence. I'm not proud of it. But I couldn't see myself robbing people or mugging them."" He is accused of driving from Brussels to pick up Salah Abdeslam late on the night of the attacks.  One of three defendants who are not in custody for the trial, he was nonetheless found to have occasionally violated the terms of his conditional release, notably by staying out late at night. ""Do you not see you could go to prison for that?"" asked the judge. ""Often in my life I act and then I reflect. That's how I ended up where I am now,"" he said. Another Belgian of Moroccan origin, Mohamed Bakkali, 34, grew up one of six children ""in a nice house and garden"".""It was a united family. I played football at a local club and went to the municipal library. I read a lot.""After leaving school he worked with his father at a garage. ""That's when I began to learn Arabic, to speak to the customers.""  At home they spoke Berber. But then he began dealing in counterfeit goods: ""Clothes, trainers, watches, perfume - I sold it all."" Bakkali is accused of helping with the logistics of the attacks. He is serving a prison term for a similar role in the so-called Thalys attack of August 2015.  In jail, where like other defendants he is kept in isolation, he has taken up studies in sociology. ""Originally I wanted to do ethnology, to discover the Berber people and my roots,"" he said. ""But then I discovered sociology. It has helped me understand the complexity of things. I am learning about the things I no longer have - social relations."" While most of the accused have Belgian or French nationality, four grew up in Sweden, Tunisia, Algeria and Pakistan. They went to Syria to join Islamic State militants and then crossed Europe in 2015. Osama Krayem, 29, was born in Malmo, the son of a Syrian father and a Palestinian mother.At 12 he appeared playing football in a Swedish television documentary on the successes of the immigrant experience. ""So you were given as an example of integration?"" asked the judge. ""Possibly."" ""You felt you were well integrated at that point?"" No, he replied: ""I lived in a neighbourhood where there was not a single Swede.""  Pakistani Muhamed Usman lost his farmer father when he was very young. He remembered enjoying cricket as a boy, but could not tell how many years he spent working in the fields and how many studying at a madrassa. ""I don't know at what age I stopped my studies. In my people we do not celebrate birthdays.""Which is a problem, because no-one can determine his age today.  Fake papers that he was carrying when arrested in Greece say he was born in 1981, but an identity card sent by Pakistani police gives his year of birth as 1993. The judge said he looked far too old to be just 28. ""I know I do not look my age. It is because of being in isolation,"" he said.  The religious motivation of the accused was not explored, nor were the steps they took that brought them to where they are.  All that must await another chapter in the trial.

57,COP26: What African climate experts want you to know,"Africa is the continent likely to bear the brunt of the effects of climate change even though studies show it has contributed least to the crisis.So even though Africa has released relatively small amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, those living on the continent are likely to be the victims of climate emergency disasters.It is already suffering from extreme weather events and changes to rainfall patterns linked to climate change - leading to droughts and flooding. With a rapidly rising population, this has knock-on effects for food, poverty and gives rise to migration and conflict. Here five climate experts tell the BBC's Dickens Olewe the issues world leaders need to remember as they hammer out solutions to rapid climate change at COP26.Dr Rose Mutiso, Kenyan - research director of Energy for Growth Hub:The average African uses less electricity each year than one refrigerator consumes in the US or Europe. But this is going to grow - especially as temperatures rise - as Africans will have to have more energy to cool their homes and irrigate farms.Africa too must be allowed to develop and build up its infrastructure - something that requires more energy.So we must simultaneously have more power for rapid economic growth and quickly find alternatives to fossil fuels to provide this energy.Yet African countries are being constrained by rich nations who make grand statements about their commitments while continuing to burn fossil fuels at home. Kenya already generates a far greater share of its renewable power than the US or Europe. While Africa welcomes partnerships, countries on the continent cannot sacrifice their ambitions. More thought needs to be given to what Africa needs in terms of industrialisation and creating jobs.This means that richer nations need to actually reduce their own emissions and they need to live up to funding promises - in the past there have been pledges but little upfront money.Dr Youba Sokona, Malian - vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:Climate change academics at African institutions are often not consulted by policymakers or governments on the continent.Their research and potential solutions are shelved for too long and almost never enter into policy debates. This fragmented approach also effects government policies. Different ministries will often be pursuing different donor-conceived ideas - with no systematic senior political co-ordination.This leads to piecemeal solutions.So donors should not dictate policy but work more closely with governments on a co-ordinated approach.This is a chance for Africa to think creatively about how to develop and address climate change at the same time. Prof Chukwumerije Okereke, Nigerian - climate governance and international development scholar:Despite the large-scale and deep impact of climate change on Africa, the support countries are given to adjust is minimal.Instead international partners focus on preventing or reducing the emission of greenhouse gases - three times more is spent on this.The global consensus seems to be that all countries must quickly achieve a target of net zero - which means not adding to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, so any emissions are balanced out by removing greenhouse gasses via plants or new technologies.This neglects the massive development and energy challenges Africa faces. Put bluntly, emissions from the continent may need to rise significantly in the near term before they fall. Many rich countries seem to be expecting Africa to leapfrog to clean technologies for producing energy - but are not so keen to commit the scale of investment needed to make it happen, though the recent deal for South Africa to reduce its reliance on coal is a step in the right direction.Fossil-fuel-rich African nations do need to know that the world is changing fast and create institutions and policies to drive a transition to green energy. There are great examples in Rwanda and Ethiopia. But much more needs to be done and poor governance remains a major barrier.Dr Christopher Trisos, South African - African Climate and Development Initiative says:Many countries in Africa already rely heavily on renewable energy - hydropower for electricity generation.But recent droughts, such as El Niño of 2015-16, caused widespread electricity shortages. Research shows future climate change could reduce hydropower capacity considerably in major African river basins - and hit the agricultural sector where many people are employed.The combination of climate change and rapid urbanisation will have devastating effects.Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would massively reduce future damage to African livelihoods, health, infrastructure, economies and ecosystems - the World Bank estimates climate change could push around 40 million more Africans into extreme poverty by 2030 if not addressed.To achieve this requires deep emission cuts, especially from high-emitting countries outside Africa. Yet investment to help African countries adapt to the changing weather, known as adaptation funding, is crucial.Between 2014 and 2018 only 46% of what was committed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for adaptation in Africa was disbursed. The quality of finance also matters as most of it is provided at the moment via loans rather than grants.This means countries that have done little to cause the climate crisis are becoming further indebted to adapt to climate change.African policymakers also need to adopt a government-wide approach so all sectors can become more climate resilient.Dr Kgaugelo Chiloane, South African - founder of KEC Environmental Solutions says:Vulnerable and poor African communities need help to adapt to the inevitable impact of climate change - but their voices must also be heard.There is a lot of traditional knowledge and expertise on the ground that is ignored.Policies are often implemented without the involvement of local communities and their buy-in.A bottom-up approach in Africa needs to be part of a government's overall climate change policy. And the ""polluter pays principle"" should be a key strategy for all governments.Article Eight of the 2015 Paris Agreement recognises the importance of addressing the loss and damage associated with adverse effects of climate change, yet there hasn't been finance allocated for this. Big carbon-emitting companies should be made to take responsibility and pay for the loss and damage they have caused as big polluters given they have generated profits for decades.

58,COP26: Time to sober up,"So how much progress has really been made in the opening days of COP26 and what are the main challenges that lie ahead?To paraphrase COP26 president Alok Sharma, this is the moment when the rubber is finally meeting the road. After a first week dominated by a blizzard of announcements of new initiatives in the real world, the conference is now moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations.The main focus will still be on devising a plan to bend the temperature curve below 1.5C.There has been quite a bit of speculation that the first week announcements made by countries and the new pledges on methane and coal have already moved the needle on the rise in global temperatures that's likely this century. According to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. At the start of the COP the latest analysis from the UN suggested a rise of 2.7C. So just how real is this large predicted drop?""None of the countries that has a net zero target has implemented sufficient short term policies to put itself on a trajectory towards net zero,"" said Dr Niklas Höhne, from the New Climate Institute, who monitor and assess national carbon cutting plans.""Right now it's more a vision, or imagination. And it's not matched by action.""As one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. Next week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. These will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. Some progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions.As deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous.""It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,"" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. ""I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work.""There will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. There is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. Despite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. The cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return.""Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,"" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. The failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. While the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely.For the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. UK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a ""cover decision"", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. The key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. The most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time.There is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed.""You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,"" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank.""I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement.""""It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.""Matt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

59,COP26: What is the Glasgow climate conference and why is it important?,"The UK is hosting a summit aimed at bringing climate change under control.The meeting, in Glasgow until 12 November, could change our everyday lives.The world is warming because of emissions from fossil fuels used by humans, like coal, oil and gas. Extreme weather events linked to climate change - including heatwaves, floods and forest fires - are intensifying. The past decade was the warmest on record and governments agree urgent collective action is needed.For this conference - called COP26 - 200 countries have been asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. They all agreed in 2015 to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try aim for 1.5C - so that we avoid a climate catastrophe.This is what's known as the Paris Agreement. It means countries have to keep cutting emissions until reaching net zero in 2050.Many countries set out plans to reduce emissions before the summit, but there has been a flurry of new announcements:COP26: So far, so good-ishUp to 25,000 people are expected in Glasgow, including world leaders, negotiators and journalists. However, the Russian and Chinese presidents have been criticised for not coming. Thousands of businesses and campaigners also go to attend events and hold protests. Expect a lot of talk about money and climate justice. Developing countries tend to pollute less per head of population and are not responsible for most emissions in the past.But they experience some of the worst effects of climate change.They need money to help reduce emissions and cope with climate change. It could mean more solar panels in countries that depend on energy from coal and flood defence systems. There will also be a battle over compensation for developing countries affected by climate change. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged $100bn (£720m) a year to help poorer nations by 2020. However, this goal has still not been met and could slip to 2023.China's commitments at COP26 are also very important. It's the world's biggest polluter, so it matters that President Xi hasn't come in person or backed the plan to reduce the use of coal. As host, the UK wants all participants to recommit to net zero emissions by 2050 - as well as big reductions by 2030.It will also want more specific pledges, like those already agreed on deforestation and methane.Developing countries will want a significant financial package over the next five years, to help them adapt to rising temperatures. Anything short of this is likely to be judged inadequate because there simply isn't more time to keep the 1.5C goal alive.However, some scientists believe world leaders have left it too late and no matter what is agreed at COP26, 1.5C will not be achieved.Top image from Getty Images.

60,Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint?,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator. The Carbon Neutral Calculator is no longer online, but the methodology behind it can still be accessed.The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only ""blue water"", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.

61,COP26: How the world is reacting to the climate summit,"It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.It's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New YorkPresident Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that ""put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as ""isolated holdouts"" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: ""Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.""There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.Go compare. A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are ""positive consequences of global warming"" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.There's no sense here of a climate emergency. Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a ""smooth"" (longer) transition to greener energy.""Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,"" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. ""I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet."" India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, ""India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions"" - a line that many here applauded. The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a ""bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West"". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept ""sledging"" or ""slurs"". And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.""Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,"" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. ""And it was never more on show than this week as he sold ""the Australian Way"" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.""Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A ""terribly messy week"" for the prime minister.The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in São Paulo.Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like São Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. It's not that Brazilians don't care.""People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,"" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. ""What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,"" Ms Cervellini says. And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.""If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,"" she says. ""We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.""Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, ""there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions"".However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed ""persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as ""enough evidence"".But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by ""demonising"" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/48DF/production/_121455681_gettyimages-1228386010.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59036722,politics
62,Delhi pollution: Are Diwali fireworks to blame?,"Air pollution levels have shot up in the Indian capital, Delhi, during the current festive season of Diwali.A lot of attention has focused on the impact of fireworks and this year India's Supreme Court has recently allowed the use of green or eco-friendly crackers.But how far are fireworks responsible for poor air quality?There are studies which show that levels of some hazardous pollutants rise significantly during the Diwali period, but there are also other factors that could account for poor air quality.Air pollution has become an increasingly serious problem in Indian cities in recent years.Around 57,000 people died prematurely in Delhi in 2020 as a result of exposure to air pollution according to Greenpeace, despite the Covid lockdown. Twenty of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India according to a World Air Quality report for 2020, with the highest annual concentrations of PM2.5 - one of the most harmful particles for human health.The levels are way above the recommended WHO guidelines for concentrations of PM2.5.Around this time of year, Delhi and other cities in northern India, experience worsening air quality because of a combination of factors, not just because of Diwali fireworks.These include:Several states have banned the sale and use of fireworks during Diwali, but the implementation of the ban is weak in many states.A 2018 study that has attempted to answer this question says there is a ""small but statistically significant"" effect from Diwali fireworks.The study focused on five locations across Delhi, and looked at data gathered between 2013 and 2016.Diwali is set according to the Hindu lunar calendar and usually happens in late October or early November.The different dates are important because they enable the authors to take into account crop burning as a factor, because that starts at the same time of year.""We used Nasa satellite data to establish when crop burning was happening in northern India,"" Dhananjay Ghei, one of the authors of the report told the BBC.In two out of the four years, crop burning did not coincide directly with Diwali celebrations.And they also point out that industrial activity in one location stopped because of the holiday, and factored the weather conditions into their calculations.They found increases in concentrations of PM2.5 of almost 40% by the second day of the festival.This then falls back to existing background levels soon after the end of Diwali.And when looked at on an hourly basis, there was a rise of 100% for the five hours after 18:00 local time - the evening darkness period when most celebrations take place.A report by Centre for Science and Environment, a non-profit based in Delhi, showed that the concentration of PM2.5 rose during Diwali in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in the capital.

63,Delhi pollution: Are Diwali fireworks to blame?,"Air pollution levels have shot up in the Indian capital, Delhi, during the current festive season of Diwali.A lot of attention has focused on the impact of fireworks and this year India's Supreme Court has recently allowed the use of green or eco-friendly crackers.But how far are fireworks responsible for poor air quality?There are studies which show that levels of some hazardous pollutants rise significantly during the Diwali period, but there are also other factors that could account for poor air quality.Air pollution has become an increasingly serious problem in Indian cities in recent years.Around 57,000 people died prematurely in Delhi in 2020 as a result of exposure to air pollution according to Greenpeace, despite the Covid lockdown. Twenty of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India according to a World Air Quality report for 2020, with the highest annual concentrations of PM2.5 - one of the most harmful particles for human health.The levels are way above the recommended WHO guidelines for concentrations of PM2.5.Around this time of year, Delhi and other cities in northern India, experience worsening air quality because of a combination of factors, not just because of Diwali fireworks.These include:Several states have banned the sale and use of fireworks during Diwali, but the implementation of the ban is weak in many states.A 2018 study that has attempted to answer this question says there is a ""small but statistically significant"" effect from Diwali fireworks.The study focused on five locations across Delhi, and looked at data gathered between 2013 and 2016.Diwali is set according to the Hindu lunar calendar and usually happens in late October or early November.The different dates are important because they enable the authors to take into account crop burning as a factor, because that starts at the same time of year.""We used Nasa satellite data to establish when crop burning was happening in northern India,"" Dhananjay Ghei, one of the authors of the report told the BBC.In two out of the four years, crop burning did not coincide directly with Diwali celebrations.And they also point out that industrial activity in one location stopped because of the holiday, and factored the weather conditions into their calculations.They found increases in concentrations of PM2.5 of almost 40% by the second day of the festival.This then falls back to existing background levels soon after the end of Diwali.And when looked at on an hourly basis, there was a rise of 100% for the five hours after 18:00 local time - the evening darkness period when most celebrations take place.A report by Centre for Science and Environment, a non-profit based in Delhi, showed that the concentration of PM2.5 rose during Diwali in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in the capital. It should be pointed out here that not all fireworks produce a lot of PM2.5 particles, although the bigger ones tend to have larger concentrations.The other caveat is around vehicle traffic, which increases in the Diwali period when people go out to buy gifts and visit family and friends.Could the higher concentrations of PM2.5 be because of more traffic on the roads rather than fireworks?The authors say they want to address this in future research.Fireworks do contain other toxic substances, including heavy metals.

64,Chinese man convicted for stealing aviation trade secrets,"A Chinese intelligence officer has been convicted by a US jury of plotting to steal secrets from aviation companies, according to the US justice department.Xu Yanjun was found guilty of five counts relating to economic espionage and trade secret theft.  He faces up to 60 years in prison and fines of more than $5m (£3.7m).Xu was first arrested in Belgium in 2018 and is possibly the first Chinese operative to be extradited to the US for trial.  Chinese authorities have not commented publicly on Friday's verdict. Beijing has previously dismissed the accusations, saying there was no basis to the charges.According to a statement by the US justice department, Xu is a senior member of the Jiangsu branch of China's Ministry of State Security - an agency responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and internal security.Xu was accused of targeting employees at several companies based in the US, among other countries since at least 2013.In one instance, he arranged for a GE Aviation employee to travel to China in 2017 to give a presentation at a university - paying for their travel expenses and a stipend. The following year, Xu asked the expert for ""system specification, design process"" information. With co-operation from the company - which was working with the FBI - the employee emailed Xu a two-page document labelled as having sensitive information.Xu later asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his work-issued computer.He also tried to arrange to meet the employee in Belgium, leading to his eventual arrest.""For those who doubt the real goals of [China], this should be a wakeup call,"" said FBI Assistant Director Alan Kohler. ""They are stealing American technology to benefit their economy and military.""The charges come at a time of raised tension between the two countries - with China recently testing a new form of hypersonic missile, and US President Joe Biden pledging to protect Taiwan from any Chinese military incursion.According to CNN, CIA Director Bill Burns described China as the greatest technological threat to the US. Last month he said the spy agency would boost its efforts towards China.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/119F9/production/_121458127_hi070510093.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59186980,politics
65,COP26: Indonesia criticises 'unfair' deal to end deforestation,"Indonesia has criticised the terms of a global deal to end deforestation by 2030, signalling that the country may not abide by it.Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said the authorities could not ""promise what we can't do"".She said forcing Indonesia to commit to zero deforestation by 2030 was ""clearly inappropriate and unfair"". Despite President Joko Widodo signing the forest deal, she said development remained Indonesia's top priority.The deal, agreed between more than 100 world leaders, was announced on Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was the event's first major announcement.It promises to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, and includes almost £14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.In a Facebook post (in Indonesian), Ms Nurbaya argued that the country's vast natural resources must be used for the benefit of its people.She cited the need to to cut down forests to make way for new roads.""The massive development of President Jokowi's era must not stop in the name of carbon emissions or in the name of deforestation,"" she said, referring to Mr Widodo by his nickname.""Indonesia's natural wealth, including forests, must be managed for its use according to sustainable principles, besides being fair,"" she said.Experts welcomed the agreement, but they warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and said commitments needed to be delivered on.Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2.Meanwhile, Indonesia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahendra Siregar said that describing the deal as a zero-deforestation pledge was ""false and misleading"".Indonesia's vast forests are still shrinking, despite a marked slow down in the deforestation rate in recent years.According to the Global Forest Watch monitoring website, in 2001 the country had nearly 94 million hectares of primary forest - defined as tropical forest that has not been completely cleared and regrown in recent history. That area had decreased by at least 10% by 2020.Read more about the COP26 summit here.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1539F/production/_121434968_hi071745736.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59169547,politics
66,"As winter looms, reports of starvation in North Korea","The warnings are stark and coming from inside and outside of North Korea. Defectors based in South Korea have told us that their families in the North are going hungry. There is a concern as winter approaches that the most vulnerable will starve.""Problems such as more orphan children on the streets and death by starvation are continuously being reported,"" said Lee Sang Yong, editor in chief of the Daily NK, which has sources in North Korea.""The lower classes in North Korea are suffering more and more,"" as food shortages are worse than expected, Mr Lee said.Getting information out of North Korea is increasingly difficult. The border has been closed since January last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China. Even getting messages out of the country to family and friends who have defected to South Korea comes at a huge risk. Anyone caught with an unauthorised mobile phone could be thrown into a labour camp. And yet some still try to send letters or voice mail via text to their loved ones and to publications in Seoul. Through these sources, some of which have to remain anonymous, we have tried to build a picture of what is going on.North Korea has always struggled with food shortages, but the pandemic has made a bad situation worse. Leader Kim Jong-un has compared the current situation to the country's worst disaster in the 1990's, known as the ""Arduous March"", where hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine.The situation is not thought to be that bad - yet. There are some hopeful signs. North Korea appears to be preparing to re-open the border with China, but it's unclear how much trade and aid will be needed to repair the economic damage already wrought on the impoverished country.This year's harvest is crucial. Last year's crops were partly destroyed by a series of typhoons. The United Nations estimates that the country is short of at least two to three months' supply of food.To ensure this year is as successful as possible, tens of thousands of people have been sent into the fields to help gather rice and corn, including the army. Kim Jong-un has also reportedly ordered that every grain of rice in the country is to be secured and that everyone who eats should go and help with the harvest.""A plan has been devised to minimise losses in the harvesting process,"" said Mr Lee, from the Daily NK. ""It emphasises that strict punishment will be imposed if theft or cheating is reported. It's creating an atmosphere of fear.""Last week, South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) told a closed-door parliamentary hearing that Mr Kim said he felt he was ""walking on thin ice due to the economic situation"", according to lawmakers at the briefing. The NIS also reportedly said the lack of medicine and essential supplies has accelerated the spread of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever.This growing concern has been amplified by state media, which has highlighted measures being taken to prevent crop damage and released propaganda posters emphasising efforts to work on food production.North Korea is facing two major issues with its food supply. The first is its farming methods. Pyongyang may have invested in new military technology and missiles, but it lacks the modern machinery needed for a speedy and successful harvest, according to experts.Choi Yongho from the Korean Rural Economic Institute told us that ""the insufficient supply of agricultural equipment results in low food productivity"".We managed to see this for ourselves.From a new lookout point in the western tip of South Korea, with the affluent skyscrapers of Seoul as a backdrop, my team and I got a good view over the Han River into North Korea. It feels so close - and yet so far.I heard one young girl remark through her binoculars that they were the ""same people"". ""They're just like us"", she said, as she bounced back to her mum.The villagers, dozens of them, were busy creating bails of rice and carrying them on their backs to a rather run-down tractor. A South Korean farmer in Paju, near the demilitarised zone which separates the two countries, said it took him an hour to strip his fields of rice with a machine. If he'd done it by hand, as it's done in the North, he said one field would take him a week.But along with the lack of technology and farming supplies, North Korea is facing a much longer-term problem if it wants to secure its food supply.The country has been listed by US intelligence agencies as one of 11 countries most vulnerable to the effects of global warming, and the limited area it has to grow crops could be the hardest hit.""Rice and maize yield failures will become more likely along the Western coastline, which is North Korea's historical breadbasket,"" said Catherine Dill, from the Council on Strategic Risks - one of the authors of a recent report on 'Converging Crises in North Korea'. That may explain why Pyongyang sent its UK ambassador to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.""North Korea is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. Flood, monsoon rains and typhoons trouble them every year which directly affect yield and indirectly cause pest problems,"" said Mr Choi.The 'Converging Crises' report suggests this will get much worse in years to come and rice production in particular will be affected by droughts and flooding.""More intense storms already appear to be affecting North Korea, there are really prominent examples of this in both the 2020 and 2021 typhoon seasons. And in terms of sea level rise, coastal areas are going to be increasingly at risk,"" Ms Dill said.While Pyongyang rarely engages with the outside world, it has often made an exception for climate change and the environment.North Korea worked with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on detailed country reports in 2003 and 2012, and is also a signatory to international treaties including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.One reason for this engagement on climate change may be its impact on food production. The 2012 UNEP report noted that the average temperature in North Korea increased by 1.9°C between 1918 and 2000, among Asia's fastest warming rates.According to a 2019 Green Climate Fund report, annual average temperatures in North Korea are further expected to rise by 2.8-4.7°C by the 2050's.South Korea sees a chance here to work together on a problem that affects them both.Seoul's Environment Minister Han Jeoung-ae told me last week that she hoped to meet her counterpart in Glasgow to talk about inter-Korean collaboration on climate change but that hasn't happened. If the North Korean delegation is listening to the speeches in Scotland they will know that even when the fear of this pandemic eases and trade with China resumes, even when goods once again start to flow over the border, the country faces a growing crisis which will profoundly affect an already vulnerable population. And it cannot overcome this on its own.Additional reporting by Shreyas Reddy of BBC Monitoring.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A69F/production/_121355624_gettyimages-668755738.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59144712,politics
67,"Deng Deng, the abandoned Shiba Inu, sells for $25k at auction in China","An abandoned dog who became an internet sensation in China has sold at auction for 160,000 yuan (£18,500; $25,000).The Shiba Inu called Deng Deng had been left at a pet training centre seven years ago and his owner never returned.A Beijing court ordered the eight-year-old dog be put up for auction after the owner could not be located.The online bidding generated enormous interest, with Deng Deng selling for 320 times the initial asking price of just $78.The auction was supposed to last for 24 hours. But it had to be extended by a further five, after attracting 480 bidders and more than 166,000 views.Driven by the rise of the cryptocurrency that shares its name, the market for Shiba Inus, a breed of Japanese hunting dogs, has exploded in recent months. Last month, billionaire Elon Musk shared a picture of his Shiba Inu puppy, Floki.Deng Deng had been left at the centre and had been incurring unpaid fees.The centre reportedly sued the owner and demanded he pay the money. But after the court failed to contact the owner, it advertised Deng Deng's auction online.The advert, and an accompanying video, went viral on Chinese social networking site Weibo, where many users expressed sympathy for the dog's plight.The Shiba Inu is an agile, small- to medium-sized hunting dog with short fur and a fox-like face.The identity of the buyer has not been disclosed.Livestreaming sales have boomed in China during the Covid pandemic as many people have been forced to stay at home under strict lockdown rules.Last month, Li Jiaqi, a livestreaming star known as China's ""lipstick king"", sold about £1.2bn worth of goods in 12 hours on e-commerce giant Alibaba's Taobao platform.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/37B8/production/_121446241_976_dog.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59175400,politics

72,"Deng Deng, the abandoned Shiba Inu, sells for $25k at auction in China","An abandoned dog who became an internet sensation in China has sold at auction for 160,000 yuan (£18,500; $25,000).The Shiba Inu called Deng Deng had been left at a pet training centre seven years ago and his owner never returned.A Beijing court ordered the eight-year-old dog be put up for auction after the owner could not be located.The online bidding generated enormous interest, with Deng Deng selling for 320 times the initial asking price of just $78.The auction was supposed to last for 24 hours. But it had to be extended by a further five, after attracting 480 bidders and more than 166,000 views.Driven by the rise of the cryptocurrency that shares its name, the market for Shiba Inus, a breed of Japanese hunting dogs, has exploded in recent months. Last month, billionaire Elon Musk shared a picture of his Shiba Inu puppy, Floki.Deng Deng had been left at the centre and had been incurring unpaid fees.The centre reportedly sued the owner and demanded he pay the money. But after the court failed to contact the owner, it advertised Deng Deng's auction online.The advert, and an accompanying video, went viral on Chinese social networking site Weibo, where many users expressed sympathy for the dog's plight.The Shiba Inu is an agile, small- to medium-sized hunting dog with short fur and a fox-like face.The identity of the buyer has not been disclosed.Livestreaming sales have boomed in China during the Covid pandemic as many people have been forced to stay at home under strict lockdown rules.Last month, Li Jiaqi, a livestreaming star known as China's ""lipstick king"", sold about £1.2bn worth of goods in 12 hours on e-commerce giant Alibaba's Taobao platform.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/37B8/production/_121446241_976_dog.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59175400,politics
73,Chinese man convicted for stealing aviation trade secrets,"A Chinese intelligence officer has been convicted by a US jury of plotting to steal secrets from aviation companies, according to the US justice department.Xu Yanjun was found guilty of five counts relating to economic espionage and trade secret theft.  He faces up to 60 years in prison and fines of more than $5m (£3.7m).Xu was first arrested in Belgium in 2018 and is possibly the first Chinese operative to be extradited to the US for trial.  Chinese authorities have not commented publicly on Friday's verdict. Beijing has previously dismissed the accusations, saying there was no basis to the charges.According to a statement by the US justice department, Xu is a senior member of the Jiangsu branch of China's Ministry of State Security - an agency responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and internal security.Xu was accused of targeting employees at several companies based in the US, among other countries since at least 2013.In one instance, he arranged for a GE Aviation employee to travel to China in 2017 to give a presentation at a university - paying for their travel expenses and a stipend. The following year, Xu asked the expert for ""system specification, design process"" information. With co-operation from the company - which was working with the FBI - the employee emailed Xu a two-page document labelled as having sensitive information.Xu later asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his work-issued computer.He also tried to arrange to meet the employee in Belgium, leading to his eventual arrest.""For those who doubt the real goals of [China], this should be a wakeup call,"" said FBI Assistant Director Alan Kohler. ""They are stealing American technology to benefit their economy and military.""The charges come at a time of raised tension between the two countries - with China recently testing a new form of hypersonic missile, and US President Joe Biden pledging to protect Taiwan from any Chinese military incursion.According to CNN, CIA Director Bill Burns described China as the greatest technological threat to the US. Last month he said the spy agency would boost its efforts towards China.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/119F9/production/_121458127_hi070510093.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59186980,politics
74,COP26: Indonesia criticises 'unfair' deal to end deforestation,"Indonesia has criticised the terms of a global deal to end deforestation by 2030, signalling that the country may not abide by it.Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said the authorities could not ""promise what we can't do"".She said forcing Indonesia to commit to zero deforestation by 2030 was ""clearly inappropriate and unfair"". Despite President Joko Widodo signing the forest deal, she said development remained Indonesia's top priority.The deal, agreed between more than 100 world leaders, was announced on Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was the event's first major announcement.It promises to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, and includes almost £14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.In a Facebook post (in Indonesian), Ms Nurbaya argued that the country's vast natural resources must be used for the benefit of its people.She cited the need to to cut down forests to make way for new roads.""The massive development of President Jokowi's era must not stop in the name of carbon emissions or in the name of deforestation,"" she said, referring to Mr Widodo by his nickname.""Indonesia's natural wealth, including forests, must be managed for its use according to sustainable principles, besides being fair,"" she said.Experts welcomed the agreement, but they warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and said commitments needed to be delivered on.Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2.Meanwhile, Indonesia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahendra Siregar said that describing the deal as a zero-deforestation pledge was ""false and misleading"".Indonesia's vast forests are still shrinking, despite a marked slow down in the deforestation rate in recent years.According to the Global Forest Watch monitoring website, in 2001 the country had nearly 94 million hectares of primary forest - defined as tropical forest that has not been completely cleared and regrown in recent history. That area had decreased by at least 10% by 2020.Read more about the COP26 summit here.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1539F/production/_121434968_hi071745736.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59169547,politics
75,"As winter looms, reports of starvation in North Korea","The warnings are stark and coming from inside and outside of North Korea. Defectors based in South Korea have told us that their families in the North are going hungry. There is a concern as winter approaches that the most vulnerable will starve.""Problems such as more orphan children on the streets and death by starvation are continuously being reported,"" said Lee Sang Yong, editor in chief of the Daily NK, which has sources in North Korea.""The lower classes in North Korea are suffering more and more,"" as food shortages are worse than expected, Mr Lee said.Getting information out of North Korea is increasingly difficult. The border has been closed since January last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China. Even getting messages out of the country to family and friends who have defected to South Korea comes at a huge risk. Anyone caught with an unauthorised mobile phone could be thrown into a labour camp. And yet some still try to send letters or voice mail via text to their loved ones and to publications in Seoul. Through these sources, some of which have to remain anonymous, we have tried to build a picture of what is going on.North Korea has always struggled with food shortages, but the pandemic has made a bad situation worse. Leader Kim Jong-un has compared the current situation to the country's worst disaster in the 1990's, known as the ""Arduous March"", where hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine.The situation is not thought to be that bad - yet. There are some hopeful signs. North Korea appears to be preparing to re-open the border with China, but it's unclear how much trade and aid will be needed to repair the economic damage already wrought on the impoverished country.This year's harvest is crucial. Last year's crops were partly destroyed by a series of typhoons. The United Nations estimates that the country is short of at least two to three months' supply of food.To ensure this year is as successful as possible, tens of thousands of people have been sent into the fields to help gather rice and corn, including the army. Kim Jong-un has also reportedly ordered that every grain of rice in the country is to be secured and that everyone who eats should go and help with the harvest.""A plan has been devised to minimise losses in the harvesting process,"" said Mr Lee, from the Daily NK. ""It emphasises that strict punishment will be imposed if theft or cheating is reported. It's creating an atmosphere of fear.""Last week, South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) told a closed-door parliamentary hearing that Mr Kim said he felt he was ""walking on thin ice due to the economic situation"", according to lawmakers at the briefing. The NIS also reportedly said the lack of medicine and essential supplies has accelerated the spread of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever.This growing concern has been amplified by state media, which has highlighted measures being taken to prevent crop damage and released propaganda posters emphasising efforts to work on food production.North Korea is facing two major issues with its food supply. The first is its farming methods. Pyongyang may have invested in new military technology and missiles, but it lacks the modern machinery needed for a speedy and successful harvest, according to experts.Choi Yongho from the Korean Rural Economic Institute told us that ""the insufficient supply of agricultural equipment results in low food productivity"".We managed to see this for ourselves.From a new lookout point in the western tip of South Korea, with the affluent skyscrapers of Seoul as a backdrop, my team and I got a good view over the Han River into North Korea. It feels so close - and yet so far.I heard one young girl remark through her binoculars that they were the ""same people"". ""They're just like us"", she said, as she bounced back to her mum.The villagers, dozens of them, were busy creating bails of rice and carrying them on their backs to a rather run-down tractor. A South Korean farmer in Paju, near the demilitarised zone which separates the two countries, said it took him an hour to strip his fields of rice with a machine. If he'd done it by hand, as it's done in the North, he said one field would take him a week.But along with the lack of technology and farming supplies, North Korea is facing a much longer-term problem if it wants to secure its food supply.The country has been listed by US intelligence agencies as one of 11 countries most vulnerable to the effects of global warming, and the limited area it has to grow crops could be the hardest hit.""Rice and maize yield failures will become more likely along the Western coastline, which is North Korea's historical breadbasket,"" said Catherine Dill, from the Council on Strategic Risks - one of the authors of a recent report on 'Converging Crises in North Korea'. That may explain why Pyongyang sent its UK ambassador to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.""North Korea is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. Flood, monsoon rains and typhoons trouble them every year which directly affect yield and indirectly cause pest problems,"" said Mr Choi.The 'Converging Crises' report suggests this will get much worse in years to come and rice production in particular will be affected by droughts and flooding.""More intense storms already appear to be affecting North Korea, there are really prominent examples of this in both the 2020 and 2021 typhoon seasons. And in terms of sea level rise, coastal areas are going to be increasingly at risk,"" Ms Dill said.While Pyongyang rarely engages with the outside world, it has often made an exception for climate change and the environment.North Korea worked with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on detailed country reports in 2003 and 2012, and is also a signatory to international treaties including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.One reason for this engagement on climate change may be its impact on food production. The 2012 UNEP report noted that the average temperature in North Korea increased by 1.9°C between 1918 and 2000, among Asia's fastest warming rates.According to a 2019 Green Climate Fund report, annual average temperatures in North Korea are further expected to rise by 2.8-4.7°C by the 2050's.South Korea sees a chance here to work together on a problem that affects them both.Seoul's Environment Minister Han Jeoung-ae told me last week that she hoped to meet her counterpart in Glasgow to talk about inter-Korean collaboration on climate change but that hasn't happened. If the North Korean delegation is listening to the speeches in Scotland they will know that even when the fear of this pandemic eases and trade with China resumes, even when goods once again start to flow over the border, the country faces a growing crisis which will profoundly affect an already vulnerable population. And it cannot overcome this on its own.Additional reporting by Shreyas Reddy of BBC Monitoring.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A69F/production/_121355624_gettyimages-668755738.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59144712,politics

77,Vietnamese minister criticised over 'Salt Bae' gold-plated steak dinner,"A Vietnamese minister has raised eyebrows after a video showed him being hand-fed gold-plated steak by celebrity chef Nusret Gokce, known as ""Salt Bae"".Public security minister General To Lam was dining at the chef's famously expensive London restaurant, Nusr-e.Critics have questioned the choice of venue, with one steak dish costing more than the minister's monthly wage.The video appeared on Mr Gokce's TikTok account but was reportedly deleted after attracting media attention.The restaurant in the upmarket Knightsbridge district has made headlines for its expensive menu. The prices are not listed on its website, but according to reviews the gold-covered steak ranges from £850 to £1,500 ($1,140 to $2,015). And that is without drinks, side dishes or the 15% service charge.It is unclear what the cost of the final bill came to or who paid it. The minister's monthly wage is between $600 to $800 per month, before any allowances.The delegates were in London after attending the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.The video, posted on 3 November to Mr Gokce's 11 million TikTok followers, showed the chef personally preparing steak dishes in front of the Vietnamese delegation, and then hand feeding one piece of meat to the general. Despite being taken down, screenshots and copies of the video were widely shared online.Human rights activist Hoang Dung was one of the first people to post the pictures on his personal Facebook page, and questioned why a work dinner had to be held at such an expensive restaurant.Many social media users denounced the opulent meal and compared it to poverty in Vietnam.""My tax money has been used for luxury,"" Radio Free Asia quoted one person as saying.""Vietnam is still poor but the minister is so luxurious, the officer is enjoying so much extravagance,"" Facebook user Mung Tin Ngo wrote.Others defended the diners, pointing out that they are entitled to a spending allowance while on business trips, while others suggested they may have been invited to the restaurant by a third party who paid.Gen To Lam's office has not yet made any comment.Vietnam, which used to be one of the world's poorest countries, has experienced significant economic growth over the past 30 years, however much of the population still lives below the poverty line.The average Vietnamese citizen earned a monthly income of around $230 in 2021, according to the General Statistics Office.The south-east Asian country's economy has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and its residents have endured strict lockdowns to keep the virus contained.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E686/production/_121441095_23ef8e3d-7640-4a19-b29e-51c2b3ae938e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59174383,politics
78,US Navy sacks commanding officers of crashed submarine,"The US Navy has sacked three top crew members aboard a nuclear submarine that crashed into an underwater mountain.Commander Cameron Aljilani and two others were removed after an investigation into the incident in the disputed South China Sea.The USS Connecticut struck the object last month, forcing the vessel to come to the surface for a week and sail to the US territory of Guam.Navy officials say the crew members ""could have prevented"" the collision.Last week, the navy said the submarine had hit an uncharted ""seamount"" while patrolling below the surface.A seamount is a mountain that rises from the ocean floor.Fifteen sailors suffered minor injuries. The submarine is currently being checked for damage at Guam in the Pacific before it returns to Washington for repairs.The incident happened amid rising tensions in the region.The USS Connecticut was operating in one of the most contested regions in the world. China claims most of the South China Sea, but surrounding countries and the US disagree.The incident happened just weeks after the US, UK and Australia agreed a historic security pact to share submarine technology in the Asia-Pacific, widely seen as an effort to counter China's power.The crash angered officials in Beijing, who have questioned what the vessel was doing in the region, and said they were worried about possible nuclear leakage.At a press briefing on Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the US needed to give a full account of the incident and ""stop its provocation"", Reuters news agency reported.US Navy officials have yet to explain how the vessel hit the seamount.Ryan Ramsey, a former British Royal Navy submarine captain, said he was shocked by the collision, which is relatively rare.""The USS Connecticut is a very modern submarine - so it's kind of surprising,"" he told the BBC. ""But if you relax at any point, then things can happen.""

80,"Inflation: Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says","Global food prices have hit the highest level in over a decade after rising by more than 30% in the last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says.The agency's figures highlighted the soaring cost of cereals and vegetable oils around the world.Vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October.Disruptions to supplies, high commodity prices, factory closures and political tensions are helping to push up prices.The FAO said its measure of cereal prices was up by more than 22% compared to a year earlier.The price of wheat was one of the major contributors to this rise, up almost 40% in the last 12 months after major exporters - such as Canada, Russia and the US - had poor harvests. ""In the case of cereals, we're facing a situation where one could say it's climate change which is ultimately causing falling production,"" Peter Batt, an agribusiness expert at Curtin Business School told the BBC.""We've had pretty bad years [of harvests] in a lot of places."" The FAO said its index of vegetable oil prices was pushed up by rises in the cost of palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils. In the case of palm oil, prices have been driven higher after output from Malaysia was ""subdued"" due to ongoing shortages of migrant workers, the FAO said.Labour shortages are helping to push up the cost of production and transportation of food in other parts of the world too.Mr Batt said: ""The other problem that has emerged is getting the product out. For example, here in Australia we've had a lot of ships arrive to take the food away but we can't get crew to come in because of Covid.""Shipping disruptions are also pushing up milk prices, with the cost of dairy products rising by almost 16% over the last year.Brigit Busicchia from Macquarie University said speculation on global markets is also contributing to price volatility: ""Since the 1990s, the deregulation of commodity futures trading has made it possible for institutional investors to enter this market on a large scale.""This is having a particular impact on countries which rely on food imports.""Expect countries like Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries to experience tensions in their provisioning of cereals,"" she said.Ms Busicchia also highlighted that rising food prices are typically felt most acutely by the poor, as disadvantaged groups are pushed further into poverty and that this has the potential to heighten social and political tensions.

81,T20 World Cup: When Indian fans are jailed for celebrating Pakistan's win,"Like millions of others around the world, Nafeesa Attari was glued to her screen as India played Pakistan in their opening match of the T20 World Cup. The schoolteacher from the northern Indian city of Udaipur watched as Pakistan won the match by 10 wickets in what was a clinical and emphatic win. Days later she was arrested and held in a police cell. Her apparent crime: her WhatsApp status celebrating Pakistan's victory. She is among several Muslims in India who have been arrested or detained for supporting Pakistan in the recent match - raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the world's largest democracy. Observers argue that these arrests are the latest weapon in the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) agenda to target Muslim minorities, a charge the government strongly denies. ""Jeeeet gayeeee… We wonnn,"" Ms Attari wrote, over an image of some of the team's players in her WhatsApp status.Her post was spotted by one of her students' parents, who sent it to others before it went viral on the messaging service. Ms Attari was fired from her teaching job, and arrested under a section of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises ""assertions prejudicial to national integration"".In an interview with a local TV channel, she appeared visibly distressed as she apologised for causing offence.""Someone messaged me [replying to my status] and asked if I was supporting Pakistan. As the message had emojis and there was a playful atmosphere, I said yes"", she said.""This doesn't mean I support Pakistan. I am an Indian, I love India.""Having secured bail, she is back home with her husband and young child, and is fighting the charges. ""What the police have done is absolutely wrong. If someone makes a mistake or if you don't agree with someone, that's not a crime or anti-national"", her lawyer Rajesh Singhvi said. ""This is against the constitution and our laws.""Rajendra Parmar, a member of the hardline Hindu nationalist group Bajrang Dal, had reported Ms Attari to the police. ""These people should go to Pakistan. You're living in India, earning here but you're celebrating their win,"" he told the BBC. Mr Parmar said he had no regrets about making the complaint. ""This should be a [lesson] for her. She's a teacher in a school. What kind of education will she give those children?""His comments cut deep into the visceral hostility many in India and Pakistan feel towards each other, ever since the two nations were created after the partition of British India in 1947. And relations are particularly tense in  Indian-administered Kashmir, where an insurgency against Indian rule has been under way since the late 1980s.A group of medical students in Kashmir have also been charged - under a strict anti-terror law - for allegedly rooting for the Pakistani cricket team. In a video which has surfaced online, a man, allegedly former BJP lawmaker Vikram Randhawa, can be heard saying the students should be ""skinned alive"" and have their degrees and citizenship cancelled for raising pro-Pakistan slogans on Indian soil. Mr Randhawa has been charged by police for hate speech, and has been reprimanded by the BJP, which has asked him to apologise within 48 hours for these remarks.  While the party is distancing itself from the use of such severe language, other senior members of the BJP have condemned those supporting Pakistan, with some saying it should be considered a crime. Former Indian cricketer turned BJP politician Gautam Gambhir said anyone who celebrated Pakistan's win was ""shameful"".  ""Those bursting crackers on Pak winning can't be Indian! We stand by our boys,"" he wrote on Twitter.Yogi Adityanath, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and chief minister of the country's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, told a newspaper that Indians who cheered the victory should be charged with sedition.India's colonial era sedition law criminalises criticism of the government. Many say it's increasingly being used to stifle free speech.""What we're seeing here is part of a political process of the BJP consolidating the Hindu vote by 'otherising' Muslims,"" said Amit Varma, host of the podcast The Seen and the Unseen.""They've weaponised issues that have been dormant in our politics for decades: cow slaughter, Hindu-Muslim marriages, and even Indians supporting Pakistan.""""None of these have any substance to them. They are just issues to whip up anti-Muslim passions which, sadly seem to be widespread,"" he argued.But a senior Indian government spokesperson said it was ""preposterous"" for anyone to say that taking action against a very small number of Muslims amounted to penalising the millions of people who belong to the faith in the country.  ""They [those arrested] were celebrating India's defeat… every such act has the potential of setting into motion a 'law and order situation', so that has to be prevented by all means,"" Kanchan Gupta, senior adviser to the ministry of information and broadcasting, told the BBC as he defended the arrests. ""If two students here, five students there, or a teacher somewhere decides to do something which is provocative and has the potential to instigate further problems, that needs to be checked… and investigated"" he added. The families of many who are being held believe the actions are wholly disproportionate. Seven people in Uttar Pradesh were also accused of celebrating Pakistan's win. Police said they had used disrespectful words and anti-national comments against the Indian cricket team to disturb the peace. Three of them - Arshad Yousef, Inayat Altaf and Shaukat Ahmad, all engineering students at a college in Agra - are in jail. The men, who have been suspended from their college, struggled to find a lawyer.""We are not going to provide any legal assistance to these students as they were celebrating Pakistan's victory while living in India,"" said Nitin Verma, president of the Young Lawyers' Association in the city. ""This is against our country and anti-national. It is our duty to oppose them, so such acts are not encouraged in the future.""This isn't the first time a cricket match has provoked such a strong response. In 2014, 60 Kashmiri students in Uttar Pradesh were charged with sedition for cheering Pakistan against India. But the charges were later dropped following legal advice from the law ministry.Cricket has always been a big part of the Indian psyche, but a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that a slim majority of adults in the country (56%) felt it was important to support India's cricket team to be truly Indian. ""When in the law is it a crime to support an opposition cricket team?"" asks Sharda Ugra, a cricket journalist and social commentator. ""Should people of Indian origin in the UK or Australia be arrested for supporting India? It's obviously a deliberate religious divide that's being provoked on both sides.""There are also examples of similar incidents on the other side of the border.In 2016, a Pakistani fan of India's cricket captain, Virat Kohli, was arrested after hoisting the Indian flag as a tribute to him. When it comes to cricket, passions run high in both nations, but these latest arrests in India have come as a shock to many who feel that the space for freedom of expression is shrinking fast.

82,Cleo Smith: How Australian police found the missing four-year-old,"Early on 3 November, police smashed their way into a house in the Australian town of Carnarvon, where they found a four-year-old girl who had been missing for 18 days. Cleo Smith disappeared from her family's tent at a campsite near Carnarvon on 16 October, triggering a massive search operation.The day after she was found, Terence Darrell Kelly, 36, appeared in court charged with forcibly or fraudulently taking or enticing a child under 16.Here's what we know about the case and what led police to Cleo.Cleo's family were on the first night of their holiday at the Quobba Blowholes camping ground when she went missing between 01:30 and 06:00 on 16 October.The remote site in Macleod is about 900km (560 miles) north of Perth, and is a local attraction on the state's Coral Coast - known for its windswept ocean scenery, sea caves and lagoons.Cleo had been sleeping on an air mattress next to her younger sister's cot. When her mother, who had been sleeping in the second room of the tent, got up in the morning, Cleo was gone and the tent door was open.Police said this raised fears of an abduction. Ms Smith was adamant Cleo would not have left the tent on her own.A major search operation involving a task force of more than 100 officers was launched.Western Australia Deputy Police Commissioner Col Blanch has described it as being like looking for ""a needle in a haystack"".The search for Cleo covered land, sea and air, with reconnaissance planes used to comb sparsely populated areas.ABC reporter Evelyn Manfield described the extensive search operation, saying police were ""up in the air, on horseback, using drones to forensically map every area inch-by-inch looking for clues"".Police even scoured through hundreds of bags of roadside rubbish along a 600km (373 mile) stretch of Western Australia.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Detective Superintendent Rod Wilde said they had to go through ""hundreds of thousands"" of pieces of evidence and testimony. ""We had to sift through a lot of information. The statements of the 100 people who were at the campsite, CCTV footage, data from phones..."" he said.  Authorities also offered a A$1m ($750,000; £540,000) reward for information on Cleo's whereabouts.Deputy Commissioner Blanch said phone data also played a key role.""It's a big jigsaw, you know, everything contributed,"" he said. ""Combined with some early information, this was dogged, methodical police work,"" said Commissioner Chris Dawson, adding that the team had ""worked their way through every lead possible"".Police have not revealed the exact details of what led them to the locked house in Carnarvon, where they found Cleo alive and well.Commissioner Dawson told reporters ""really important"" information about a car helped direct police to the house on Wednesday though he has not elaborated on what that information was. Detective Wilde said that police were able to ""build a picture of who was supposed to be there and who was not supposed to be there"" by piecing together all the information they received and by ""placing people in certain locations at certain times"".He added that things had become ""clearer"" on Tuesday afternoon, which led them to arresting their suspect. Local media reports have stated that a man - now known to be Mr Kelly - was removed from his vehicle and arrested hours before police rescued Cleo.Police say they believe the alleged kidnapper was acting alone. ""There were lots of things, that when we put the puzzle together it all led to one place, and that's where we found Cleo,"" said Commissioner Dawson. But the investigation into the events of that night are still not over. Police are still trying to piece together exactly what happened. They have appealed to businesses and individuals in the area to provide them with CCTV footage from between 15 October and 2 November. There is also much we don't know about Cleo's experience of the abduction. Police said they have experts who will interview her, but warned that it could take days before they got any useful information out of her. ""It will take as long as it takes,"" Detective Wilde said, adding that they had to be careful not to upset her. Her family is also being counselled on the next steps with regards to both Cleo's wellbeing and the progression of the case.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D824/production/_121323355_fdpnyz9uyaocxmz-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-59144556,politics
83,Climate change: Can India meet its targets?,"India's Prime Narendra Modi has set his country a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070, a significantly later deadline than many other countries attending the Glasgow climate summit.India also set itself a deadline of 2030 to reduce its emissions by one billion tonnes. After China and the US, India is the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2). With its rapidly growing population and an economy heavily dependent on coal and oil, its emissions are set on a steep upward trajectory unless radical action is taken to curb them.India has resisted setting a target for an overall reduction, saying industrialised nations should bear a much greater share of the burden as they have contributed far more to emissions over time.It says an ""emissions-intensity"" target, which reflects a country's economic growth, is a fairer way to compare it with other countries, it says.  By 2030 India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45%, says Mr Modi - a more ambitious target than the previous goal of a 33-35% cut in its emissions intensity from the 2005 level by 2030.However, a fall in carbon intensity does not necessarily mean a reduction in overall emissions.And India's relatively rapid economic growth in recent years has been driven by its reliance on fossil fuels - accounting for most of the country's greenhouse-gas emissions. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a target of global net zero - where a country is not adding to the overall amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050 is the minimum needed to keep the temperature rise to 1.5C.And more than 130 countries have publicly promised to meet this.India's prime minister has pledged that it will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.This is an ambitious target given that it currently has a capacity of around 100GW and had previously set itself a target of 175GW by next year.Also in 2015, India promised to provide 40% of all electric power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.  Mr Modi has now increased this figure to a significantly more ambitious 50%.Generation capacity from these sources stands at around 39% as of September this year, according to India's official statistics.But the actual amount generated in 2020 was lower at around 20%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Cindy Baxter, of CAT, says developing countries such as India, need international support to decarbonise their economies and limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in line with the Paris Agreement. ""India has no plan to decarbonise,"" Ms Baxter said.""Nor does it have a conditional target that identifies where it needs support or indeed how much support it needs.""India has highlighted many times it wants to bring a third of its land area under forest cover. But it has not given a timescale for this - and progress has been patchy.Although there have been replanting initiatives in the southern parts of India, the north-eastern region has lost forest cover recently.The expansion of green cover acts a carbon sink.And India plans to plant enough trees by 2030 to absorb an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.Global Forest Watch - a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Google, the United States Geological Survey and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) - estimates India lost 18% of its primary forests and 5% of its tree cover between 2001 and 2020. But the Indian government's own survey data indicates a 5.2% increase in forest cover between 2001 and 2019.This is because the GFW report includes only vegetation taller than 5m (16ft), whereas India's official calculation is based on tree density over a given area of land.Additional research by David BrownThe Cop26 global summit, in Glasgow, in November, is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions - and it could lead to major changes to everyday lives.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/92B2/production/_121245573_gettyimages-1231813272.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58922398,politics
84,How the Taliban takeover changed my life,"The Taliban's sudden sweep to power in Afghanistan has upended lives across the country. When a reporter recently asked Afghans to describe their jobs before and after, the powerful responses showed how many are dealing with radically changed circumstances. The BBC has been speaking with some of those - from office workers to activists - who wanted to share their stories. Ahmed was working as an office manager with an Afghan private company before the Taliban seized power. He had been working there since September 2019. ""It was a good time for me because I was working and supporting my sisters who were at university and school,"" he told the BBC. ""I had a good salary at that time and that was almost enough for my family too because I was saving money and sending some home for food.""""I had many friends at work and all of them lost their jobs and became jobless,"" he added. ""But now life is more difficult for me, especially for my family, because there is no job for people here and no way of income for families.""Ahmed is the only son and the eldest in his family. His father, who is around 60 years old, cannot work because of his age and an issue with his knee. ""It makes me feel more responsible,"" he said, adding that the price of food is increasing daily. ""It is boring for us every day.""Zahra was studying at university just before the Taliban takeover and has not been able to resume her classes. ""The perfect period of my life was when I was a medical student,"" she said. ""I tried for two years to get my dream score in the university enrolment exam and it was worth it. It hurts because I tried a lot but I returned with empty hands.""""Life now is not living. It is surviving and breathing without any purpose. This is not the life that I was dreaming of when I was a school student and getting ready for the university enrolment exam.""I was in love with studying with my friends and I really miss being a student,"" she said. Zahra says most of her time now is spent at home and she misses being able to go out ""without any hesitation"". ""I'm working to improve my English and learn new things from books but unfortunately the situation is depressing. ""Maybe we will return to our studies one day,"" she added. Sana was involved in women's rights activism in Afghanistan. ""Before the Taliban came, we were deprived of many of our rights but we were happy because we had some freedom,"" she said. ""We could study, work, go out with our friends, sit together, argue and laugh.""""We were happy to fight for our rights together..... we tried to change laws but suddenly everything changed and we moved away from our homeland.""She is currently living in Iran and has a visa for Germany but has not yet left. ""I hope this is like a bad dream and I wake up and return home soon. It is hard for me to be away from my motherland,"" she said. ""It is hard for me to lose everything we made. I am physically alive but I miss my family and home. I miss my people, my language, the efforts we made. ""I have migrated but my soul is left in Afghanistan and it is wounded.""Sayed was working as a journalist and anchor for one of the largest media outlets in Afghanistan. ""I miss my professional life as a journalist, and all the dreams I had to progress in my professional career back home. I feel devastated to remember the moments now,"" he said.Sayed was working on the day the Taliban took control of Kabul and by that afternoon, things had already changed. ""Our office was almost empty, all female staff had left the office and our technical team had changed their clothes to that of ordinary people."" Sayed is in the US and seeking asylum as a refugee. His family remain in Afghanistan.""The 20 years' progress and sacrifice were all shattered and everything is ruined, including my hopes and dreams in a matter of hours,"" he said. ""Everything fell apart so quickly, I still can't believe it. ""Life is tough now being away from loved ones in a totally different environment, where I can absorb the trauma, which is easier said than done."" All names have been changed to protect the identity of the contributors.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15A37/production/_121213688_09a9bfb4-c439-4cf1-bb98-c2a6d494a614.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59029517,politics

87,US offers $10m bounty for Colonial Pipeline hackers,"The United States government has offered a bounty of up to $10million (£7.4m) for information about the hacking group known as DarkSide.In May, a DarkSide ransomware attack shut down a vital 5,500-mile-long fuel pipeline on the east coast of the US.The pipeline carries 45% of the fuel used on the east coast.The bounty is offered for information which can lead to the ""identification or location of any individuals"" in a leadership position with DarkSide.A separate $5m reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of anybody ""conspiring to participate"" in a DarkSide ransomware attack.The cyber-attack caused fuel shortages after the Colonial Pipeline company shut down its operations for several days.It eventually paid the $4.4m ransom in Bitcoin.Crypto-currency analysis company Elliptic estimated that DarkSide had received at least $90m in ransom payments from 47 victims.However, US authorities later said 63.7 Bitcoin, the majority of the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, had been recovered.$10m is the largest bounty ever offered for the arrest of a specific cyber-criminal.The ignominious record was previously held by Maksim Yakubets, the alleged mastermind behind another ransomware gang called Evil Corp.The US named and shamed him (along with help from the UK authorities) in 2019.Before that, the record bounty stood at $3m for another alleged cyber-crime boss called Evgeniy Bogachev.The thing these individuals have in common?They are thought to be living care-free lives in Russia safe from any prospect of arrest from the local police, who routinely ignore western accusations against Russian hackers.Even with their names, pictures and a rough location published by the US, these alleged criminals are safe.The US seems to have even less to go on in terms of unmasking DarkSide's leaders, although most research suggests they are also in Russia.So, despite the eye-watering sums being offered by the US, the chances of these criminals facing justice are slim.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86FA/production/_121445543_mediaitem121445542.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59176826,technology
88,Zuckerberg's metaverse: Lessons from Second Life,"This week, I travelled back in time to visit the future.It has been about 10 years since I first entered the virtual world of Second Life, arguably the internet's first attempt at what every tech giant is now racing to build: the so-called metaverse.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science-fiction novel, Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality successor to the internet, where people live large portions of their lives in virtual environments. Second Life peaked in the late 2000s with millions of users and hundreds of excitable headlines about people devoting hours of their daily lives to live digitally.Since then, I assumed it had died a slow and quiet death. But how wrong I was. The platform seems to have a small, loyal and potentially growing community of ""residents"", as they call themselves, logging on to experience what our metaverse future could look like.So for this week's Tech Tent podcast, I dipped back in.In terms of visuals, it is far from groundbreaking. It is more akin to the blocky and pixelated world of Roblox than a blockbuster game built around gorgeous immersive environments.But the difference here, of course, is that, like Mark Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse, Second Life is not a game. There are no gaming challenges or quests or storylines. It is just a place to hang out.One resident I met was Rei. Our avatars bumped into each other after teleporting to a seaside world modelled on a strange rundown 1960s Scottish fishing village. He told me he had been spending time in Second Life for about four months after ""getting curious about all this metaverse stuff"". Rei is not a fan of Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse. ""They'll want to control everything. But I think the people should be in charge and it should be fully open,"" he told me. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of the newly renamed company Meta, addressed these concerns when he announced his grand plans. ""It's a future that is beyond any one company. That will be made by all of us,"" he said in his Facebook Connect keynote.Other large corporations, including Microsoft, Epic Games, Roblox and even Nike have announced plans to enter the metaverse in some form.Rei's concern about a metaverse monopoly is one shared by many, including Anya Kanevsky, vice-president of product management at Linden Lab - the company running Second Life. Anya has watched with interest as several tech giants have started to talk about the new idea of a life online. Second Life has been going since 2003.""I'm a little bit concerned about the dystopian nature that the conversation seems to be taking on right now,"" she says.""The entry of a slightly oversized and outsized player into the space seems to signal to people that they are not the owners of it, that someone else is going to be setting the rules and kind of running the show and they will just be the consumers.""Second Life, then, is much like Roblox - a place where users build environments and invite others to play - although it has far fewer participants. Roblox's record for concurrent players is estimated to be around 5.5m compared with Second Life's 90,000.Mark Zuckerberg says he, too, wants to put a community of users at the heart of his metaverse but he does not have any residents yet. Instead, he has pledged to take on 10,000 employees across Europe to build his worlds.Some argue that it's not even about allowing users more control: a metaverse should be built entirely by communities. John Carmack, the consulting chief technology officer of Oculus, Meta's virtual-reality headset division, believes that setting out to build a metaverse ""is not actually the best way to wind up with the metaverse"". As reported by Ars Technica, he said: ""I doubt a single application will get to that level of taking over everything. I just don't believe that one player - one company - winds up making all the right decisions for this.""Second Life's story also has more lessons to teach Mr Zuckerberg and others. At its peak, the site attracted negative headlines after high-profile virtual riots, Ponzi schemes based on the in-game currency and even issues around child grooming.Even in my short exploration this week, I caught glimpses of the moderation challenges that Second Life faces. Those would be amplified if a metaverse went mainstream.Searching for events or places with certain keywords such as ""porn"" or ""drugs"" is blocked.However, searching for ""sex"" took me to virtual strip clubs where I was offered digital lap dances in exchange for in-world money.""The approach to governance in a virtual world is complex,"" says Ms Kanevsky. ""Some of it can be automated away but a lot of it must have the human touch. It's not all just escapist behaviour and pretty dresses and gorgeous avatars.""Back in Second Life, I asked Rei one last question before I logged off: why does he keep coming back? He answered: ""I like to dream with my eyes"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/892B/production/_121451153_63b88357-eaec-4ba7-a773-22a929e844f5.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59180273,technology
89,Facebook's metaverse plans labelled as 'dystopian' and 'a bad idea',"One of Facebook's earliest investors has labelled the social media giant's plans for a metaverse as ""dystopian"".Meta, as Facebook is now known, is investing billions in the project.But Roger McNamee told the BBC: ""It's a bad idea and the fact we are all sitting and looking at this like it's normal should be alarming everyone.""Meta's chief product officer Chris Cox told attendees at the Web Summit in Lisbon that the idea would make ""the internet less flat"".He said it would be considerably better than video conferencing as a space for meetings.However, speaking at the same event, Mr McNamee was highly sceptical.""Facebook should not be allowed to create a dystopian metaverse,"" he said.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science fiction novel Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual reality successor to the internet.Mr McNamee became a critic of Facebook as he began to see more misinformation on the platform. He said he was not convinced the metaverse would be safe in chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's hands.""There's no way that a regulator or policymaker should be allowing Facebook to operate there [in the metaverse] or get into cryptocurrencies,"" he said.""Facebook should have lost the right to make its own choices.

93,Instagram: A blessing or a curse?,"Wake up, reach for your phone, open Instagram and start scrolling.It is an all-too familiar routine for many of us. But how does the app affect our mental health?Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen warned that Instagram was ""more dangerous than other forms of social media"", after it was revealed that the company's own research showed it could be harmful. At the time, Instagram said the research showed its ""commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues"".As politicians continue to scrutinise social media, the BBC spoke to five people about their experiences on Instagram.Dani has a love-hate relationship with Instagram. The 29-year-old from South Wales, makes a living from the platform, and has built a community for trans people to connect online.But she has received abuse for the way she looks. ""Instagram is the biggest blessing and biggest curse of my life"", Dani tells the BBC.""When you're a trans person with an account that isn't private, it opens you up to abuse anyway - but some of the hate I've had online has been soul-destroying.""The hateful comments were vile. Someone even sent me a thread where people had taken images of me and were ridiculing me.""Frances Haugen told a joint committee of MPs and Lords that Instagram is about ""social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids.""Dani, who has beaten an alcohol addiction, says she can see how social media can feel addictive. ""I've been sober for a few years now, but I feel Instagram is bad for people with addictive personalities. It's the same feeling you get, the need to have more and more.""Sir Nick Clegg, vice-president of global affairs at Instagram's parent company Meta, has defended the platform, saying that the ""overwhelming majority"" of teenage girls enjoy using it.He said the company would be introducing tools to tackle harmful use of Instagram, including a nudge feature called ""take a break"", which will prompt young users to log off.Hannah spends six to 10 hours a day on social media, which she has had access to since she was a teenager. The 24-year-old, who is studying at the University of the West of Scotland in Ayr, has an account on all the major platforms; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok.""I have got this really bad habit of first thing in the morning checking all my notifications,"" she explains.""It's the last thing I check before I go to sleep. My whole day revolves around my social media. ""I'm definitely addicted to TikTok, I can easily scroll through for a couple of hours at a time. I know I am basically wasting time... there are times when I try and limit it.""On Instagram, Hannah used to follow influencers who made her feel bad about her body image.""It got me thinking that my body needed to look like theirs, and I began to have unrealistic expectations of being a slim model. I found it was really damaging my mental health, so I took a step back and unfollowed them.""Now she has changed who she follows, swapping influencers for body-positive accounts.""I realised not everyone is a size six, super skinny, six-foot model. I've started to follow people who look more like me, and that's improved my body confidence.""Hannah has received some hateful comments on Instagram.""I got comments from some people telling me I need to lose weight because I'm getting too fat - and I'm only a size ten. It made me feel negative about my body.""At Hornsey School for Girls in North London, Scarlett and Anisa tell the BBC they are aware of the dangers of social media.Scarlett is 15 and uses all the platforms except Facebook, which she does not think is for people her age.""I follow YouTubers that create content about fashion, like Emma Chamberlain, who I love,"" she says.""But when I see someone of a really high beauty standard when I've just finished going through puberty, it's really difficult because seeing that makes me think I should look like that. It has made me feel insecure.""I've unfollowed a lot of accounts.""Anisa, who is also 15, changes the accounts she follows, to try to avoid negative content.But she has still seen things online that she did not want to see.""I've noticed some people's accounts create a toxic environment. Because I'm a teen, I know I need to watch out for brainwashing,"" says Anisa.""As a Muslim, I feel like there is really bad representation of us... so if I see that type of content I unfollow.""The girls say they have also had enjoyable experiences on social media, especially when it comes to making videos with their friends. Scarlett says; ""I've tried a lot of cooking video recipes and I've learned a lot of skills from videos online. ""There are also accounts with amazing facts on there, and tips and tricks and life advice - it's not all bad, although the negatives probably outweigh the positives.""Not everyone at the school is on Instagram. Leah, who is 15, has not been allowed to set up an account yet. ""It's because of all the negative things that are out there, so I trust my mum's decision,"" she says.""I would quite like to have social media, because all my friends have it and I sometimes I feel out of the loop, but I know the bad side to it too. I have heard a lot of stories about my friends receiving inappropriate pictures and horrible videos - stuff people our age shouldn't be watching.""In September, Meta - then still called Facebook - paused plans to make an ""Instagram experience"" for under-13s, dubbed ""Instagram Kids"".The company said it would take time to listen to ""parents, experts, policymakers and regulators"", Instagram head Adam Mosseri said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E3E9/production/_121454385_070998013-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59180946,technology
94,US offers $10m bounty for Colonial Pipeline hackers,"The United States government has offered a bounty of up to $10million (£7.4m) for information about the hacking group known as DarkSide.In May, a DarkSide ransomware attack shut down a vital 5,500-mile-long fuel pipeline on the east coast of the US.The pipeline carries 45% of the fuel used on the east coast.The bounty is offered for information which can lead to the ""identification or location of any individuals"" in a leadership position with DarkSide.A separate $5m reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of anybody ""conspiring to participate"" in a DarkSide ransomware attack.The cyber-attack caused fuel shortages after the Colonial Pipeline company shut down its operations for several days.It eventually paid the $4.4m ransom in Bitcoin.Crypto-currency analysis company Elliptic estimated that DarkSide had received at least $90m in ransom payments from 47 victims.However, US authorities later said 63.7 Bitcoin, the majority of the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, had been recovered.$10m is the largest bounty ever offered for the arrest of a specific cyber-criminal.The ignominious record was previously held by Maksim Yakubets, the alleged mastermind behind another ransomware gang called Evil Corp.The US named and shamed him (along with help from the UK authorities) in 2019.Before that, the record bounty stood at $3m for another alleged cyber-crime boss called Evgeniy Bogachev.The thing these individuals have in common?They are thought to be living care-free lives in Russia safe from any prospect of arrest from the local police, who routinely ignore western accusations against Russian hackers.Even with their names, pictures and a rough location published by the US, these alleged criminals are safe.The US seems to have even less to go on in terms of unmasking DarkSide's leaders, although most research suggests they are also in Russia.So, despite the eye-watering sums being offered by the US, the chances of these criminals facing justice are slim.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86FA/production/_121445543_mediaitem121445542.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59176826,technology
95,Zuckerberg's metaverse: Lessons from Second Life,"This week, I travelled back in time to visit the future.It has been about 10 years since I first entered the virtual world of Second Life, arguably the internet's first attempt at what every tech giant is now racing to build: the so-called metaverse.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science-fiction novel, Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality successor to the internet, where people live large portions of their lives in virtual environments. Second Life peaked in the late 2000s with millions of users and hundreds of excitable headlines about people devoting hours of their daily lives to live digitally.Since then, I assumed it had died a slow and quiet death. But how wrong I was. The platform seems to have a small, loyal and potentially growing community of ""residents"", as they call themselves, logging on to experience what our metaverse future could look like.So for this week's Tech Tent podcast, I dipped back in.In terms of visuals, it is far from groundbreaking. It is more akin to the blocky and pixelated world of Roblox than a blockbuster game built around gorgeous immersive environments.But the difference here, of course, is that, like Mark Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse, Second Life is not a game. There are no gaming challenges or quests or storylines. It is just a place to hang out.One resident I met was Rei. Our avatars bumped into each other after teleporting to a seaside world modelled on a strange rundown 1960s Scottish fishing village. He told me he had been spending time in Second Life for about four months after ""getting curious about all this metaverse stuff"". Rei is not a fan of Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse. ""They'll want to control everything. But I think the people should be in charge and it should be fully open,"" he told me. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of the newly renamed company Meta, addressed these concerns when he announced his grand plans. ""It's a future that is beyond any one company. That will be made by all of us,"" he said in his Facebook Connect keynote.Other large corporations, including Microsoft, Epic Games, Roblox and even Nike have announced plans to enter the metaverse in some form.Rei's concern about a metaverse monopoly is one shared by many, including Anya Kanevsky, vice-president of product management at Linden Lab - the company running Second Life. Anya has watched with interest as several tech giants have started to talk about the new idea of a life online. Second Life has been going since 2003.""I'm a little bit concerned about the dystopian nature that the conversation seems to be taking on right now,"" she says.""The entry of a slightly oversized and outsized player into the space seems to signal to people that they are not the owners of it, that someone else is going to be setting the rules and kind of running the show and they will just be the consumers.""Second Life, then, is much like Roblox - a place where users build environments and invite others to play - although it has far fewer participants. Roblox's record for concurrent players is estimated to be around 5.5m compared with Second Life's 90,000.Mark Zuckerberg says he, too, wants to put a community of users at the heart of his metaverse but he does not have any residents yet. Instead, he has pledged to take on 10,000 employees across Europe to build his worlds.Some argue that it's not even about allowing users more control: a metaverse should be built entirely by communities. John Carmack, the consulting chief technology officer of Oculus, Meta's virtual-reality headset division, believes that setting out to build a metaverse ""is not actually the best way to wind up with the metaverse"". As reported by Ars Technica, he said: ""I doubt a single application will get to that level of taking over everything. I just don't believe that one player - one company - winds up making all the right decisions for this.""Second Life's story also has more lessons to teach Mr Zuckerberg and others. At its peak, the site attracted negative headlines after high-profile virtual riots, Ponzi schemes based on the in-game currency and even issues around child grooming.Even in my short exploration this week, I caught glimpses of the moderation challenges that Second Life faces. Those would be amplified if a metaverse went mainstream.Searching for events or places with certain keywords such as ""porn"" or ""drugs"" is blocked.However, searching for ""sex"" took me to virtual strip clubs where I was offered digital lap dances in exchange for in-world money.""The approach to governance in a virtual world is complex,"" says Ms Kanevsky. ""Some of it can be automated away but a lot of it must have the human touch. It's not all just escapist behaviour and pretty dresses and gorgeous avatars.""Back in Second Life, I asked Rei one last question before I logged off: why does he keep coming back? He answered: ""I like to dream with my eyes"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/892B/production/_121451153_63b88357-eaec-4ba7-a773-22a929e844f5.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59180273,technology

He said he was not convinced the metaverse would be safe in chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's hands.""There's no way that a regulator or policymaker should be allowing Facebook to operate there [in the metaverse] or get into cryptocurrencies,"" he said.""Facebook should have lost the right to make its own choices. A regulator should be there giving pre-approval for everything they do. The amount of harm they've done is incalculable.""Mr Cox, speaking for Meta, put forward a different view - that the metaverse idea is the next step for the internet as a whole, not just for his company.""Technology often starts in lower resolutions versions of what it becomes,"" he said.Feedback from Meta's Oculus virtual reality headset users was that the technology, which was improving all the time, could be ""incredibly fun"".Mr Cox told Nicholas Carlson, editor-in-chief of news publication Insider, that his own dabbling in the metaverse included hosting meetings and entertainment for staff.He said he and his wife had watched a comedy show with Facebook employees in which everyone appeared as avatars: ""Twenty of us in the room, co-workers, all laughing together.""That same technology was a good alternative to video calls, he argued.""Everyone is exhausted by video conferencing.

100,US offers $10m bounty for Colonial Pipeline hackers,"The United States government has offered a bounty of up to $10million (£7.4m) for information about the hacking group known as DarkSide.In May, a DarkSide ransomware attack shut down a vital 5,500-mile-long fuel pipeline on the east coast of the US.The pipeline carries 45% of the fuel used on the east coast.The bounty is offered for information which can lead to the ""identification or location of any individuals"" in a leadership position with DarkSide.A separate $5m reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of anybody ""conspiring to participate"" in a DarkSide ransomware attack.The cyber-attack caused fuel shortages after the Colonial Pipeline company shut down its operations for several days.It eventually paid the $4.4m ransom in Bitcoin.Crypto-currency analysis company Elliptic estimated that DarkSide had received at least $90m in ransom payments from 47 victims.However, US authorities later said 63.7 Bitcoin, the majority of the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, had been recovered.$10m is the largest bounty ever offered for the arrest of a specific cyber-criminal.The ignominious record was previously held by Maksim Yakubets, the alleged mastermind behind another ransomware gang called Evil Corp.The US named and shamed him (along with help from the UK authorities) in 2019.Before that, the record bounty stood at $3m for another alleged cyber-crime boss called Evgeniy Bogachev.The thing these individuals have in common?They are thought to be living care-free lives in Russia safe from any prospect of arrest from the local police, who routinely ignore western accusations against Russian hackers.Even with their names, pictures and a rough location published by the US, these alleged criminals are safe.The US seems to have even less to go on in terms of unmasking DarkSide's leaders, although most research suggests they are also in Russia.So, despite the eye-watering sums being offered by the US, the chances of these criminals facing justice are slim.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86FA/production/_121445543_mediaitem121445542.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59176826,technology
101,Zuckerberg's metaverse: Lessons from Second Life,"This week, I travelled back in time to visit the future.It has been about 10 years since I first entered the virtual world of Second Life, arguably the internet's first attempt at what every tech giant is now racing to build: the so-called metaverse.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science-fiction novel, Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality successor to the internet, where people live large portions of their lives in virtual environments. Second Life peaked in the late 2000s with millions of users and hundreds of excitable headlines about people devoting hours of their daily lives to live digitally.Since then, I assumed it had died a slow and quiet death. But how wrong I was. The platform seems to have a small, loyal and potentially growing community of ""residents"", as they call themselves, logging on to experience what our metaverse future could look like.So for this week's Tech Tent podcast, I dipped back in.In terms of visuals, it is far from groundbreaking. It is more akin to the blocky and pixelated world of Roblox than a blockbuster game built around gorgeous immersive environments.But the difference here, of course, is that, like Mark Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse, Second Life is not a game. There are no gaming challenges or quests or storylines. It is just a place to hang out.One resident I met was Rei. Our avatars bumped into each other after teleporting to a seaside world modelled on a strange rundown 1960s Scottish fishing village. He told me he had been spending time in Second Life for about four months after ""getting curious about all this metaverse stuff"". Rei is not a fan of Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse. ""They'll want to control everything. But I think the people should be in charge and it should be fully open,"" he told me. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of the newly renamed company Meta, addressed these concerns when he announced his grand plans. ""It's a future that is beyond any one company. That will be made by all of us,"" he said in his Facebook Connect keynote.Other large corporations, including Microsoft, Epic Games, Roblox and even Nike have announced plans to enter the metaverse in some form.Rei's concern about a metaverse monopoly is one shared by many, including Anya Kanevsky, vice-president of product management at Linden Lab - the company running Second Life. Anya has watched with interest as several tech giants have started to talk about the new idea of a life online. Second Life has been going since 2003.""I'm a little bit concerned about the dystopian nature that the conversation seems to be taking on right now,"" she says.""The entry of a slightly oversized and outsized player into the space seems to signal to people that they are not the owners of it, that someone else is going to be setting the rules and kind of running the show and they will just be the consumers.""Second Life, then, is much like Roblox - a place where users build environments and invite others to play - although it has far fewer participants. Roblox's record for concurrent players is estimated to be around 5.5m compared with Second Life's 90,000.Mark Zuckerberg says he, too, wants to put a community of users at the heart of his metaverse but he does not have any residents yet. Instead, he has pledged to take on 10,000 employees across Europe to build his worlds.Some argue that it's not even about allowing users more control: a metaverse should be built entirely by communities. John Carmack, the consulting chief technology officer of Oculus, Meta's virtual-reality headset division, believes that setting out to build a metaverse ""is not actually the best way to wind up with the metaverse"". As reported by Ars Technica, he said: ""I doubt a single application will get to that level of taking over everything. I just don't believe that one player - one company - winds up making all the right decisions for this.""Second Life's story also has more lessons to teach Mr Zuckerberg and others. At its peak, the site attracted negative headlines after high-profile virtual riots, Ponzi schemes based on the in-game currency and even issues around child grooming.Even in my short exploration this week, I caught glimpses of the moderation challenges that Second Life faces. Those would be amplified if a metaverse went mainstream.Searching for events or places with certain keywords such as ""porn"" or ""drugs"" is blocked.However, searching for ""sex"" took me to virtual strip clubs where I was offered digital lap dances in exchange for in-world money.""The approach to governance in a virtual world is complex,"" says Ms Kanevsky. ""Some of it can be automated away but a lot of it must have the human touch. It's not all just escapist behaviour and pretty dresses and gorgeous avatars.""Back in Second Life, I asked Rei one last question before I logged off: why does he keep coming back? He answered: ""I like to dream with my eyes"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/892B/production/_121451153_63b88357-eaec-4ba7-a773-22a929e844f5.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59180273,technology
102,Facebook's metaverse plans labelled as 'dystopian' and 'a bad idea',"One of Facebook's earliest investors has labelled the social media giant's plans for a metaverse as ""dystopian"".Meta, as Facebook is now known, is investing billions in the project.But Roger McNamee told the BBC: ""It's a bad idea and the fact we are all sitting and looking at this like it's normal should be alarming everyone.""Meta's chief product officer Chris Cox told attendees at the Web Summit in Lisbon that the idea would make ""the internet less flat"".He said it would be considerably better than video conferencing as a space for meetings.However, speaking at the same event, Mr McNamee was highly sceptical.""Facebook should not be allowed to create a dystopian metaverse,"" he said.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science fiction novel Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual reality successor to the internet.Mr McNamee became a critic of Facebook as he began to see more misinformation on the platform. He said he was not convinced the metaverse would be safe in chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's hands.""There's no way that a regulator or policymaker should be allowing Facebook to operate there [in the metaverse] or get into cryptocurrencies,"" he said.""Facebook should have lost the right to make its own choices. A regulator should be there giving pre-approval for everything they do. The amount of harm they've done is incalculable.""Mr Cox, speaking for Meta, put forward a different view - that the metaverse idea is the next step for the internet as a whole, not just for his company.""Technology often starts in lower resolutions versions of what it becomes,"" he said.Feedback from Meta's Oculus virtual reality headset users was that the technology, which was improving all the time, could be ""incredibly fun"".Mr Cox told Nicholas Carlson, editor-in-chief of news publication Insider, that his own dabbling in the metaverse included hosting meetings and entertainment for staff.He said he and his wife had watched a comedy show with Facebook employees in which everyone appeared as avatars: ""Twenty of us in the room, co-workers, all laughing together.""That same technology was a good alternative to video calls, he argued.""Everyone is exhausted by video conferencing. You don't know who is looking at who, everyone is constantly interrupting each other.""Meetings in the metaverse would be far better, he said, with Meta working on how to improve ""spatial audio and body language"" in virtual reality.When asked why anyone would want to meet in virtual reality, he said: ""It will not replace real life - nothing should - and I don't want to design something that does.""He acknowledged that no one company, such as Meta, would own the metaverse, pointing to Roblox as an example.Roblox, a user-generated gaming platform valued at $30bn (£22bn) and with 37 million users around the globe, has its own plans for the metaverse.Chief executive David Baszucki has for several years been outlining his vision of it as a digital place where people play, work or learn with millions of 3D experiences.At Web Summit, Roblox's head of music Jon Vlassopulos told the BBC: ""I think our view of the metaverse is that we've been at it for about 15 years. ""So we're ushering in the metaverse, and we feel it needs to be a place that everyone can access, a place where people can express themselves and connect together.""We've been building around this vision for a long time. We're excited that more people are coming it to validate that notion.""Mr Cox was asked whether the metaverse - which Mr Carlson described as a ""cartoon world"" - was something that the tech giant should control.He said that there would need to be ""a set of standards and a set of protocols"" along with ""public discourse"" about how to keep the space safe.He added that Mr Zuckerberg was committed to safety, something he said the ""company had been working on for over a decade"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A020/production/_121429904_gettyimages-1351042109.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59154520,technology
103,Instagram post previews to return on Twitter,"Instagram has brought back support for Twitter card previews after removing the feature nine years ago.Now, when users share an Instagram link on Twitter, a small preview of the post will be displayed.Instagram controversially removed the feature shortly after being acquired by Facebook in 2012.Twitter card previews started for some users on Wednesday and will eventually be available to everyone. Instagram and Twitter are both promoting the change.""If you want to share your latest Instagram post on the Twitter timeline too, you're in luck: now when you share a link to an IG post in a tweet, it'll show up as a card with a preview of the photo,"" read a tweet on Twitter's official support account.Instagram sparked controversy with users when it removed support for Twitter cards in 2012. The platform said that it wanted to take back control of its content following its merger with Facebook. Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom insisted at the time that the mandate came from himself, and not Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg. He said Instagram was attempting to grow its web platform and shared hopes that the move would help increase traffic.

104,EA says NFTs are part of the future of games industry,"Game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) has told investors that collectible NFTs are ""an important part of the future of our industry"".NFTs have erupted in popularity in recent months as a way to buy and sell digital-only art and collectible items. EA makes the Fifa football series, which uses ""card packs"" to ""collect"" players in its Ultimate Team mode.Chief executive Andrew Wilson told investors he believes Fifa players want to see NFTs in the franchise.""[Players] want more modalities at play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11-on-11 football,"" he told an earnings call.""They want more digital experiences outside the game - esports, NFTs, broader sports consumption and they want us to move really, really quickly.""But he also said that NFT ideas were ""still really, really early"" and came with a ""a lot of hype"".""It's still early to kind of figure out how that's going to work,"" he warned.Bringing NFTs into gaming is sometimes presented as an idea called ""play to earn"", based around the idea that unique digital items can increase in value over time - and be sold off later for profit.PC Gamer reports that recent job listings at EA have included references to NFTs and the underlying technology they run on, the blockchain.But the idea is controversial among gamers. Major PC gaming platform Steam has banned blockchain and NFT-based games from its platform, while its rival Epic has not. Some game designers believe the concept is bad for gaming overall, but other studios - including major player Ubisoft - are apparently embracing the idea.Games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere said NFT and blockchain games ""are new disruptive forces within the games sector"".He said all major publishers would be looking at the potential of these formats to make money - and ""EA is no exception"".""It would be bad commercial practice not to be analysing how these technologies could impact its existing business,"" he said.NFTs are already seeing use in the sports collectables market, he added: ""I see a strong fit between [Fifa's card-based] Ultimate Team and the use of NFTs, but there are implications that need to be considered - not least the ongoing value and utility of NFTs, especially in the context of the season renewal which drives most activity within this mode of the game.""On the earnings call, Mr Wilson seemed to echo that seasonal sentiment - in which sports games such as FIFA are released annually and reflect the current sports calendar.""Collectability in games like Fifa and Madden and NHL, is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season,"" he said.""Is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystems to expand that value over time? I think the short answer to that is 'yes'.""I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players… but we will continue, as we have evolved the Ultimate Team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0D19/production/_121435330_gettyimages-1232967391.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59167668,technology
105,New York's next mayor wants to be paid in Bitcoin,"Eric Adams, mayor-elect for New York City, has said he would like his first three paycheques in Bitcoin.The former police captain was elected this week to take over at the end of mayor Bill de Blasio's term in January.Mr Adams said on social media that he wanted to signal his intention to make New York the ""centre of the cryptocurrency industry"".The value of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been highly volatile, since it was created in 2009.Mr Adam's comments appear to be an attempt to one-up the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, who had already said in his own Twitter message that he would take his first paycheque in Bitcoin, after he was re-elected.Mr Suarez has already said he would like to establish Miami as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation.Mr Adams upped the stakes by asking for three months' pay in the cryptocurrency.  ""In New York we always go big, so I'm going to take my first three pay checks in Bitcoin when I become mayor,"" Mr Adams wrote in a Twitter post. ""NYC is going to be the centre of the cryptocurrency industry and other fast-growing, innovative industries!

106,Nintendo warns chip shortage will hit Switch sales,"Nintendo has lowered forecasts for sales of its Switch handheld games console by 1.5 million units.The Kyoto-based game giant now says it expects to sell 24 million units this financial year - having previously forecast sales of 25.5 million units.The Animal Crossing maker said the new forecast was because of a change in its production plan, due to the effects of the worldwide semiconductor shortage.Chip designers ARM recently warned the scarcity could delay Christmas gifts.""Our shipment forecast for the second half was reduced because of the change in our production plan due to the effects of the global semiconductor shortage,"" Nintendo wrote in a document to go with its financial results.""On the other hand, we revised the Nintendo Switch software forecast up"" it said, predicting that it would sell 10 million more games than it had previously thought, bringing the total to 200 million.A number of other companies have been predicting supply issues.Simon Segars, chief executive of chip design firm Arm, told a conference the mismatch between supply and demand is ""the most extreme"" he has ever seen, with the wait for chip supplies taking up to 60 weeks.""If you haven't bought all your devices yet, you might be disappointed,"" he warned delegates at the Web Summit event.Next generation games consoles like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, have been in short supply since the start of the pandemic.In September, Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer said that short supply of next generation consoles was due to many issues - not just a chip shortage - and would continue beyond Christmas.""I think regretfully it's going to be with us for months and months, definitely through the end of this calendar year and into the next calendar year"" he told The Wrap.Analysts say the shortage will continue to have an impact across all kinds of consumer electronics Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told investors that ""larger than expected supply constraints"" in the three months to September, had cost the company $6bn (£4.5bn) in lost sales.Ranjit Atwal, a senior research director with Gartner, told the BBC: ""The component shortage issues are industry-wide, and no vendor is immune from the impact - some may get preferential treatment, but all will be impacted.""For consumers 'first-come, first-served' will be the motto for Christmas.""Glenn O'Donnell, a technology analyst at Forrester, said the problem was unlikely to be fixed soon.""Semiconductor chips have become the basic ingredient in a wide variety of products - home appliances, consumer electronics, and toys are all affected,"" he said.""Even Apple struggles to get these essential parts. An ample supply of chips will not come until well into 2023, perpetuating the electronic supply chain for another two years or so.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1077F/production/_119255476_ci_nswitch_oled_vivid_colors.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59156677,technology
107,"Climate change: Facebook fails to flag denial, study finds","Climate change denial is spreading unchecked on Facebook, two studies by disinformation researchers have found. The Center for Countering Digital Hate and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said less than 10% of misleading posts were marked as misinformation.And the CCDH researchers linked the majority of these to just 10 publishers. Facebook said this represented a small proportion of climate change content.The CCDH is a non-profit organisation which monitors and lobbies against online hate and misinformation. It found that of 7,000 misleading posts describing climate change as ""hysteria"", ""alarmism"", a ""scam"", or other related terms, only 8% were marked as misinformation.Facebook pledged to flag climate denial content early this year. The CCDH looked at a sample of posts from the past year which attracted roughly 700,000 likes and shares. Researchers used social media analytics tool Newswhip to search for strings of key words including ""climate change"", global warming"" and, ""fraud"", ""hoax"", ""cult"", ""scam"", ""lie"" and so on.The researchers manually reviewed every post to make sure it met their definition of climate denial and was not a post condemning such beliefs. Highly shared articles made false assertions that climate change was not confirmed by science or claimed to debunk it with data. Of these, 69% could be traced back to just 10 ""super-polluter"" publishers - dubbed the ""toxic ten"" - the campaign group found.In fact, our understanding of climate change comes from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. And multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era.Many of the shared articles also pushed the unsubstantiated belief that ""climate lockdowns"" will be enforced on populations. Yet scientists point out this is highly unlikely given there is no evidence the Covid lockdowns led to a significant improvement for the climate. These posts represent the most extreme types of outright climate denial, according to the CCDH. They can't tell us the true scale of climate misinformation on the site but they do indicate climate conspiracy content is spreading without being labelled or removed by Facebook. Campaign group Stop Funding Heat, working together with think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said it had found far more misinformation which more generally ""undermines the existence or impacts of climate change, the human influence on climate change, and the need for urgent action"".Research published on Thursday analysed 48,700 posts between January and August 2021 and found just 3.6% posts containing climate misinformation included a fact-checking label. The group also identified 113 ads on Facebook with messages like ""climate change is a hoax"" between January and October 2021 with an estimated spend of between $58,000-$75,000 (about £42,000- 55,000). This appears to be a particular issue on Facebook. Counter-extremism think tank the ISD discovered during the 2021 German election that most of the top shared posts relating to renewable energy on the site (18 out of 25) either doubted climate change or criticised climate action. They found a similar trend on conversations around fossil fuels, with most of the top shared posts on Facebook (19 out of 25) arguing against climate action. On Twitter, on the other hand, the trend was reversed with most posts on the subjects promoting the scientific evidence or in support of climate action.Although the majority of the publishers of climate denial identified by CCDH were in the US, people from Brazil, India, Poland, Haiti, Mexico, Thailand, Russia, France and Germany were among their top viewers. And there were climate denial posts analysed by ISD from the UK, Australia, Russia, India, Poland, South Africa and Japan.A spokesperson, speaking on behalf of the Facebook platform, said the 700,000 interactions with the posts analysed by the CCDH made up a small fraction of the total 200 million interactions with climate change content on the site.""We continue to combat climate misinformation by reducing the distribution of anything rated false or misleading by one of our fact-checking partners,"" the spokesperson said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CF20/production/_121342035_gettyimages-1235859368.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/59147659,technology
108,NSO Group: Israeli spyware company added to US trade blacklist,"The Israeli company behind the controversial Pegasus spyware has been added to a US trade blacklist.Pegasus has reportedly been used by nation states to target the phones of rights activists and journalists.The US has now put its maker, NSO Group, on its ""entity list"", banning business dealings with them.NSO Group said it was ""dismayed"" by the decision, adding that its technology helped maintain US national security by ""preventing terrorism and crime"".It has long maintained that its software is sold only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records.But earlier this year, it was accused of having sold its technology to authoritarian governments, which then targeted innocent people.""We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world's most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based on the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products,"" the company said in a statement.However, US officials said that NSO Group and another Israeli firm, Candiru, had acted ""contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States"".On the face of it this is a surprising move by the US government. The US and Israel are close allies, with their respective cyber-experts having co-operated, for example, to restrain Iran's nuclear programme. But the Pegasus military-grade spyware developed and sold by Israel's NSO Group has emerged as a formidable cyber-weapon, used by some of its more autocratic customers in the Middle East to target a wide range of people, not just criminals and terrorists. Journalists, lawyers, peaceful activists and even a member of the UK's House of Lords have all had their phones secretly infected with malware that allows the customer to read every message, access all their data and even remotely turn on the microphone without the owner's knowledge. The US Commerce Department said the decision was ""based on evidence that these entities developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used these tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, business people, activists, academics and embassy workers.""These tools have also enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists outside of their sovereign borders to silence dissent. Such practices threaten the rules-based international order,"" it said.It also said the announcements were part of President Biden's efforts to ""stem the proliferation of digital tools used for repression"".A Russian and a Singaporean company - which created hacking tools - were also added to the US trade blacklist.Separately, the US State Department said it would not be taking action against Israel, Russia or Singapore, based on the actions of the individual companies.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/769B/production/_121336303_gettyimages-596871414.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59149651,technology
109,New ways into the lucrative world of data science,"What is a data scientist? The job title sprang out of nowhere as technology firms have scrambled to find people to perform sophisticated analytical tasks over the last decade. Reports of six-figure salaries abounded as businesses competed for staff to slice and dice data in pursuit of business lessons and emerging trends.Recruitment firm PageGroup cites annual salaries for data science work of between £60,000-150,000, while cautioning that the job title covers a huge range of disciplines and responsibilities. The line has become blurred between data science and other tasks such as data analysis. James Hobson, a technology specialist at PageGroup notes that ""there are different interpretations of what constitutes a data scientist"".Whatever the title, demand for staff has outstripped the supply of those traditionally considered suitable to the work, usually candidates with doctorates in computer science.A 2020 report into emerging jobs in the US by LinkedIn estimated that data science vacancies were growing at 37%  a year. So new entrants are coming into the field from unorthodox routes, aided by new software packages. Edward Green and Balraj Oates are two of those, although they both hesitate over the data scientist label. For Mr Green, his data science journey began at 15 when he embarked on series of extended stays in London's Great Ormond Street Hospital while being treated for a complex medical problem that required three bouts of surgery over two and a half years. Most of us would prefer to forget such an ordeal. But Mr Green remembers it as his gateway to a career working with technology. ""The day I had my first surgery was the day the iPad was released,"" he says. He joined the hospital's patient council and began capturing medical data on an iPad so it could be displayed to patients. This experiment saw him head straight into IT from school. His surgeon had worked with McLaren, studying the application of F1 pit stop techniques to the movement of patients in and out of intensive care. So motor racing - and work at McLaren's technology centre just outside London where data from cars are analysed - was his next step. At McLaren he uses data science software from US firm Alteryx that has developed its own self-service tool which can help people to become data experts.For Mr Green, it trained him to juggle vast quantities of data. In McLaren's case that means 1.5 terabytes worth collected from every race.  ""Sometimes the drivers feel they don't need this data, but they do,"" he says.More Technology of BusinessEuan Davis researches the future of work at Cognizant, a technology services group. He says that perceptions of the field have changed.""Data science used to be a very dry job. It was seen as nerdy but now it's creative. Communication matters because you have to sell what you uncover and that means telling stories around data."" The future belongs to people with soft skills just as much as to those who master hard data analysis, he says. ""The data science position is becoming a hybrid role. Now it's about being a trusted advisor. The data scientist has to be able to read the data in a way that tells something important to business executives.""Data visualisation tools, software that translates complex information into simple images, have changed the data science game, says Mr Davis: ""The tools are getting easier to use and more intuitive.""Various data analysis businesses such as Tableau and Cloudera offer this type of program, translating information into simple charts and icons for data scientists and others. This approach recognises that not everyone is comfortable trying to extract clear information from the bewildering columns of figures that appear in large spreadsheets. This new technology has created a grey area between the work of a data scientist and data analyst.Traditionally a data analyst might spend more time on routine analysis and providing regular reports. A data scientist would be responsible for the way data is manipulated. Mr Davis thinks this technology will prove reassuring in an era when ""our jobs are changing around machines and we have to understand data"".  Data science represented a dramatic change of direction for Balraj Oates.She was introduced to the discipline via a competitive event, a hackathon where players analysed global Covid case data to create regional comparisons of the pandemic. Alteryx software allowed her to drag and drop icons representing data sets such as death rates.Importantly, by manipulating icons rather than pages of calculations she could match the speed of analysis of a statistician on her team. She compares working with data science tools to using a calculator. This, she says, ""started my data journey"". It propelled her back into the working world after a 12-year break raising three children.Mrs Oates spotted the hackathon on the Women Returners website, which helps professionals returning to work after an extended career break.She mentioned her data science experience to another mother at her children's school who turned out to be seeking a data development specialist. Mrs Oates now applies her new-found knowledge in the financial services industry while her eldest child studies coding. ""It's never too late to think about developing a career and it's more accessible than you think"" Mrs Oates says, before adding how important it is to market yourself. ""I got into this work through a conversation at the school gate!""

110,Revealed: The Cryptoqueen's £13.5m London penthouse,"A money-laundering trial in Germany is shining a light on the purchase of a luxury London penthouse by cryptocurrency scammer Dr Ruja Ignatova. Jamie Bartlett and Rob Byrne of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast explain how she used British-based lawyers and wealth managers - who continued to offer their services after she disappeared.A former porter at the exclusive Abbots House apartment block in Kensington remembers meeting Dr Ruja Ignatova in 2016, as she returned from a shopping trip with her Bulgarian bodyguards. ""These two poor men came behind her like overloaded donkeys, struggling, and a bit out of breath - they must've had 20 bags each,"" says James (not his real name).Dr Ruja had been splashing out on designer-label goods - Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Calvin Klein - without regard for the expense.A little later, James got a look inside her four-bedroom penthouse flat, complete with swimming pool.""She had an Andy Warhol painting stuffed in the cupboard, and that broke my heart because I went to art college,"" says the ex-policeman.That was a print of the actress, Elizabeth Taylor. Another Warhol, Red Lenin, hung above the fireplace. To the left of a sofa in another reception room was a print of Queen Bubblegum by Michael Moebius, showing Queen Elizabeth blowing a bubble. Private Eye later estimated the flat contained works of art worth £500,000, bought from London's Halcyon gallery. James wondered whether Dr Ignatova was deliberately spreading her suspect wealth into assets that could be easily moved, to avoid them being seized.On 17 September Dr Ruja's German lawyer, Martin Breidenbach, went on trial in Münster, accused of money laundering for transferring 20 million euros to a London law firm to fund the purchase of the luxury property. Two others are also in the dock, facing charges connected to the siphoning of millions of euros from Dr Ruja's €4bn scam - which consisted of selling something that didn't exist, a fake cryptocurrency she called OneCoin.When the lease was signed in August 2016, financial regulators in at least one European country had already issued a warning about OneCoin. A few months earlier, Dr Ruja had pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges in a German court, after bankrupting a metal factory she'd bought and leaving 150 people jobless in 2011.But this wasn't widely known. Lawyers at Locke Lord, a US law firm with an office in London, did express concern about the source of the 20 million euros being transferred - this is apparent from internal emails revealed later in a US court case. But Dr Ruja's companies passed the firm's compliance checks, so they proceeded with the purchase of the property, along with Aquitaine Group, a Guernsey company offering tax haven services to wealthy clients.The penthouse had been refurbished by luxury property developers Candy & Candy after a fire that broke out while it was the London home of the singer, Duffy. The estate agent was Knight Frank. But quite who had bought the flat remained unclear to the outside world, thanks to British tax haven secrecy. According to the property deed its owner is Abbots House Penthouse Limited. This is an anonymous Guernsey shell company - one of 12,000 such companies that own properties in England and Wales - meaning that Dr Ruja's name would not have to appear on the UK deed, or in public records in the Channel Island. Other Guernsey firms were appointed as directors (or ""nominees""), and a couple of months after Dr Ruja's offer was accepted, Aquitaine was listed as the company's ""resident agent"" in Guernsey. The London address of Locke Lord, meanwhile, appeared on the penthouse's Land Registry documents. This appears to have been enough to conceal Dr Ruja's purchase of the property from the City of London Police, which told swindled OneCoin investors in September 2019 that they were ""unable to identify any OneCoin assets in the UK"".The truth was only revealed two months later, in emails read out in the money-laundering trial of a former Locke Lord employee in the US, Mark Scott.Some people in the area claim to remember their infamous ex-neighbour, but we've been told she only stayed briefly, in 2016.That year she seemed to be preparing to put down roots in London. She opened an office at the exclusive 1 Knightsbridge building and celebrated her 36th birthday with a lavish party at the Victoria and Albert Museum. We've also heard that she was making plans for her daughter to go to a private school in the UK one day.But mostly the 7,000 sq ft of the ""ultimate penthouse"", as Candy & Candy described it, remained empty. So far as we can tell, Dr Ruja didn't visit her Kensington pad at all in 2017 - and then on 25 October that year she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens, and vanished off the face of the Earth.James, the former porter, used to visit the flat daily to ventilate it. ""It was like a greenhouse up there,"" he said. The summer heat and direct light warped doors and faded the expensive artwork. Sometimes he would chase out pigeons that entered through a badly closing door.Occasionally other people connected with OneCoin would come to stay. In July 2018, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin - who took over as head of the scam a few months after her disappearance - posted a selfie taken inside the penthouse.James also remembers friends of Konstantin's visiting, and has identified Frank Schneider, Dr Ruja's head of security, as another guest who spent time there after she disappeared.Konstantin was arrested at Los Angeles International airport on 6 March 2019 and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. Schneider, the former head of Luxembourg's spy agency, was detained in France in April this year at the request of US authorities, and a decision on his extradition is expected this month.James says Schneider had been trying to arrange the sale of the penthouse, but our sources tell us it was rented out instead. Photos from a 2019 rental listing, also with Knight Frank, showed the Red Lenin still above the fireplace. There was no sign of the Liz portrait, but the eagle-eyed could spot the face of Dr Ruja herself on a special plate, gifted by one of her top promoters. We're told she hated it. While the flat was being prepared for renting, representatives of Aquitaine came and went. One had the locks changed. A former employee of Dr Ruja's told us that another carried out sacks full of luxury possessions.Law firm Locke Lord also continued to offer its services to Dr Ruja long after she went missing. A letter admitted in evidence at the US trial of ex-employee Mark Scott shows that on 12 July 2018 James Channo, a partner at the London branch of the firm, wrote to Dr Ruja about her UK properties.""We believe it is important that we revisit the manner in which you hold your real estate interests in the UK,"" he wrote.The letter, addressed to Dr Ruja at a Sofia address, was sent a couple of months before Scott's 2018 arrest, nine months after Dr Ruja's sudden disappearance, and 22 months after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority revealed in a warning to potential investors that the City of London Police was investigating OneCoin. Investigations into OneCoin or affiliated companies had also been announced in a number of other countries. Setting out the scope of the work he would like to do for £600 per hour, Mr Channo also sent email versions to Konstantin and Frank Schneider, all the while noting that email communication was ""not fully secure"".The letter contained no specific details of the UK properties, but Mr Channo cautioned Dr Ruja about the need to re-evaluate her UK property holdings, ""factoring issues such as tax, discretion of holding to the extent possible, and simplicity of structure"".A statement provided by Locke Lord and James Channo said the letter was an offer of legal services ""in a standard form"", that it was disclosed by Locke Lord to US prosecutors, and that no work was done for Dr Ruja as a result. One interesting line in the letter confirmed what our sources had been telling us - that it wasn't just the penthouse Dr Ruja had bought in the UK. On the fifth floor of Abbots House there's a less fancy two-bedroom apartment that ex-porter James told us Dr Ruja's bodyguards would stay in.UK records show the owner of 11 Abbots House is also a Guernsey shell company, Abbots Property Limited, and that it too is registered at Aquitaine's address. The smaller flat was also bought in 2016 - for £1.9m. Her name was again kept off the paperwork, but our sources say she was the one behind the purchase.Asked by the BBC about its dealings with Dr Ruja, Aquitaine said it had no comment to make. After she disappeared, 11 Abbots House seems to have taken on a different function, serving as a secret storage facility, which our sources tell us at one point housed two large safes. We've been told it was the immediate destination for valuables that were hurriedly cleared out of the penthouse by her staff, with the help of an Aquitaine employee, before it was rented out. Where Dr Ruja's luxury clothes, jewellery, shoes and some of her artwork went after that remains a mystery - like nearly everything with her. A former employee told us that her ""very coveted"" Louboutin shoes probably went to a charity shop, but couldn't account for the final destination of all of her possessions.It's possible some answers are known across the English Channel, in Guernsey.The existence of these London properties is interesting news for millions of victims of the OneCoin scam, who want Dr Ruja's assets to be sold and the proceeds distributed among investors. However, complex ownership structures - the Guernsey shell companies may be just the start - could make it difficult to prove that Dr Ruja is the legal owner.In the wake of the Pandora Papers, campaigners have repeated calls for a register of offshore property owners, which the UK government has promised but has so far failed to deliver. After pressure from MPs, in 2019 Guernsey and other Crown dependencies committed to making public the owners of companies based within their jurisdiction - but not until 2023.Victims campaigner Jen McAdam said the news that British-based lawyers, offshore wealth managers and estate agents were involved when Dr Ruja bought properties in London filled her with revulsion and anger.""This is almost certainly OneCoin victims' money that these properties have been purchased with, victims who for the last five years have been facing unimaginable emotional suffering and immense financial loss,"" she said. ""Now is not the time for the companies to remain quiet about their involvement, now is the time to be open, transparent and tell the truth. We want answers.""The BBC estimates that investors in the UK alone lost more than £100m. Jen McAdam also criticised the City of London Police for closing its investigation into OneCoin without making any charges in September 2019.A police spokesperson commented: ""The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations and will continue to do so. We have advised the investors with whom we have interacted with to contact the relevant law enforcement organisations directly.""Lawyers for James Channo and Locke Lord, the legal firm used by Ruja to buy the Kensington properties, emphasised that OneCoin had never been among its clients. It said Mark Scott's work for OneCoin was not done on behalf of Locke Lord and that the company had not been aware of it until he was charged with money-laundering, almost two years after he had left the company.Knight Frank, the estate agent, told the BBC: ""We always comply with our legal and regulatory obligations when carrying out financial transactions, and where appropriate, interact with the relevant authorities.""Martin Breidenbach, Dr Ruja's German lawyer, denies money-laundering. His trial is expected to last until May.Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast on BBC Sounds - the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova continues, and new episodes are planned in 2022",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/96FD/production/_121235683_redlenin_roof976.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-59062959,technology
111,Why Africa urgently needs its own genetic library,"It was just a ""crazy idea"" to start with, says Ambroise Wonkam, professor of medical genetics at Cape Town university in South Africa.He is talking about his vision of creating a huge library of genetic information about the population of Africa, outlined in the science journal Nature, earlier this year.The Three Million African Genomes (3MAG) project emerged from his work on how genetic mutations among Africans contribute to conditions like sickle-cell disease and hearing impairments. He points out that African genes hold a wealth of genetic variation, beyond that observed by scientists in Europe and elsewhere.""We are all African but only a small fraction of Africans moved out of Africa about 20-40,000 years ago and settled in Europe and in Asia,"" he says.Prof Wonkam is also concerned about equity. ""Too little of the knowledge and applications from genomics have benefited the global south because of inequalities in health-care systems, a small local research workforce and lack of funding,"" he says.Only about 2% of the genomes mapped globally are African, and a good proportion of these are African American. This comes from a lack of prioritising funding, policies and training infrastructure, he says, but it also means the understanding of genetic medicine as a whole is lopsided. Studies of African genomes will also help to correct injustices, he says: ""Estimates of genetic risk scores for people of African descent that predict, say, the likelihood of cardiomyopathies or schizophrenia can be unreliable or even misleading using tools that work well in Europeans.""To address these inequities, Prof Wonkam and other scientists are talking to governments, companies and professional bodies across Africa and internationally, in order to build up capacity over the next decade to make the vision a reality. The number of three million is the minimum he expects to accurately map genetic variations across Africa. As a comparison, the UK Biobank currently aims to sequence half a million genomes in under three years, but   the UK's 68 million population is just a fraction of Africa's 1.3 billion. Prof Wonkam says the project will take 10 years, and will cost around $450m (£335m) per year, and says  industry is already showing an interest in it.Biotech firms say they welcome any expansion of the library of African genomes.The Centre for Proteomic and Genomic Research (CPGR) in Cape Town works with biotech firm Artisan Biomed on a variety of diagnostic tests.  The firm says it is affected by the gaps in the availability of genomic information relevant to local populations.For example, it may find a genetic mutation in someone and not know for certain if that variation is associated with a disease, especially as a marker for that particular population.""The more information you have at that level, the better the diagnosis, treatment and eventually care can be for any individual, regardless of your ethnicity,"" says Dr Lindsay Petersen, chief operations officer.More Technology of BusinessArtisan Biomed says the data it collects feeds back into CPGR's research - allowing them to design a better diagnostic toolkit that is better suited to African populations, for instance.""Because of the limited data sets of the African genome, it needs that hand in hand connection with research and innovation, because without that it's just another test that has been designed for a Caucasian population that may or may not have much of an effect within the African populations,"" says Dr Judith Hornby Cuff. She says the 3MAG project would help streamline processes and improve the development of research, and perhaps one day provide cheaper, more effective and more accessible health care, particularly in the strained South African system. One of those hoping to take part in the 3MAG project is Dr Aron Abera, genomics scientist at Inqaba Biotech in Pretoria, which offers genetic sequencing and other services to research and industry.The firm employs over 100 people in South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Currently, most of the genetics samples collected in these countries are still processed in South Africa, but Dr Abera hopes to increase the number of laboratories soon.The gaps are not only in infrastructure, but also in staff. Over the last 20 years, Inqaba has focused on using staff and interns from the African continent - but it now has to expand its training programme as well.Back in Cape Town, Prof Wonkam says that while the costs are huge, the project will ""improve capacity in a whole range of biomedical disciplines that will equip Africa to tackle public-health challenges more equitably"".He says: ""We have to be ambitious when we are in Africa. You have so many challenges you cannot see small, you have to see big - and really big.""Additional reporting by Tim Bowler",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11792/production/_120807517_wonkam2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58788040,technology
112,Can we stomach the latest emerging food innovations?,"As world leaders gather in Glasgow, and prepare to chow down at numerous COP26 buffets, food technologists urgently want them to grasp the role alternative proteins might play combatting climate change. Researchers in many countries are looking for alternatives to traditional meat because farming animals is helping to drive up global temperatures.Even Hollywood stars have been jumping on the alternative protein bandwagon with with Leonardo Di Caprio among the most vocal. But aside from film stars, where are Wall Street and some of Europe's biggest institutional investors putting their money? We take a look at three of the hottest areas of this deliciously weird science.  Our thirst for non-dairy milk is already huge. One in three Brits now drink plant-based milk on a regular basis, says retail sector analyst Mintel. So, perhaps regularly eating meat that's never mooed, oinked, or encountered a farm may be a logical next step?No longer just the vision of a Margaret Attwood novel stuffed with chickienobs, in December 2020, Singapore became the first country to approve the sale of protein grown entirely in a laboratory. Scientists start by harvesting muscle cells from an animal, nutrients are steadily then added to feed those cells and grow the meat into tissue - this stew is called the cell media, which is then cultivated.San Francisco-based start-up, Eat Just, is now selling its lab-grown chicken nuggets in Singapore, a move that's part of the country's long-term security strategy so it can be less dependent on its neighbours for food imports. So, what are the barriers to many other countries doing the same? ""The real driver for all of this is getting regulatory approval,"" says Dr Carsten Gerhardt, a partner at consultancy, Kearney, which analyses the food and agriculture sectors. Some countries have more appetite for this than others. In Europe, the Netherlands is at the forefront of lab-grown meat technology where analysts expect producers Moas Meat and Meatable to push for EU regulatory approval in the next few years. In the US, it is widely expected that Bill Gates-backed Memphis Meats and New Age Meats will do the same.  But regulation isn't the only hurdle to scaling-up and expanding the cultured-meat business, bringing down ingredient costs will be crucial. Most producers are still working with pharmaceutical-grade ingredients and nutrients, but if ""those could be lowered to normal food quality grades instead, then costs would come down significantly"", explains Mr Gerhardt. One part of the standard recipe involves growing cells in a syrupy bath of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), taken from pregnant cows' blood but Dutch scientists have now successfully replaced it and other animal components in its process. ""For ethical reasons, as well as for the simple reason FBS is very expensive and we could never produce meat at large scale for a broadly accessible price, we've succeeded in developing our own entirely animal component-free growth media,"" "" a company spokesperson for Mosa says.Still, farming meat in a lab is a slow, energy-intensive process and optimising this will also mean making the series of heating and cooling steps involved, much more energy efficient, although Jessica Almy, vice president of policy at The Good Food Institute says some producers are not that far off. Two separate studies out earlier this year found that, with investment, the production cost of cultivated meat could drop to compete with conventional meat by 2030. The Life Cycle study showed cultivated meat is also projected to comprise a staggering 35% of the global meat market by 2040.Several glowing reports suggest lab-grown meat may bring big environmental benefits - lower emissions plus less land and water usage than conventional farming. However, a more recent US study on expanding in-vitro production warns those benefits could come at the expense of much more intensive energy use as the whole process moves away from agriculture and becomes industrialised. Cyrille Filott, global strategist for consumer foods for Rabobank, says the question is how many boxes the lab grown product will tick for ""early adopters"" to remain interested. ""Taste, texture, price, sustainability, a long list of boxes. Will the novelty wear off or stick?""Mr Filott adds that an important intermediate milestone will be the acceptance of hybrid products. Hybrid products are plant-based meat substitutes that contain lab grown ingredients such as fats. If these products are accepted by the consumer, he says the development of fully lab-grown products might accelerate.A handful of firms are now working on 3D printers that could construct this dinner while you wait, by printing thousands of pre-programmed, sliver-thin layers, stacked on top of each other. The ""ink"" used is your food in paste format: printers that can design bespoke pancakes, ice cream and confectionery are already popular in some high-end supermarkets.However, Ms Almy says companies are now testing the water with much more sophisticated versions. 3D bio-printing can print cells and materials together to create a more complex structured product, like a marbled beef steak. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Extrusion technologies which have been used in the food industry for years - think hot dogs and pasta - are also being applied successfully in cultivated meat production. Barcelona firm Novameat has come up with one of the most realistic alternative meat products so far, thanks in part to its founder Giuseppe Scionti's expertise in bioengineering and tissue regeneration. It uses micro-extrusion tech to intricately print plant-based proteins in layers that build up in to a large cut of meat strong enough, and with the right texture, to be sliced with a carving knife, like a Sunday roast.Working with the faculty of biomedical engineering at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel-based firm Aleph Farms also created the worlds' first lab grown rib eye steak in this way, using 3D printing, in February.Alternatively, 3D printing can be used to create scaffolds from plant-based materials that allow cells to attach and grow into the final meat-based product. And if all this wasn't exciting enough, some printers then zap the result with lasers that will sizzle the food until it is cooked. Nanotechnology, or the science of manoeuvring teeny-tiny things around, is more commonly talked about in the manufacture of chips for phones, than fries. However, it also has many potential applications in the food sector. Using miniscule nanomaterials it is now possible to create packaging that keeps the products held inside edible for longer. Nanopack is a cling-film-like prototype for packaging that has smaller-than-the-eye-can-see mineral nanotubes dispersed inside it - these hold natural essential oils from plants like oregano and thyme with antimicrobial properties. The nanotubes slowly release antimicrobial oils from the film into the headspace of the packaged food which actively slows down oxidation, moisture changes and microbial growth, says Prof Ester Segal from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology who oversaw the project.  Early experiments showed the film prevented the growth of mould in bread by three weeks and extended the sale time of fresh cherries and shelf life of cheese by 40% and 50%, respectively.The supermarket of the future may go even further, incorporating intelligent food packaging with tiny nanosensors, which Dr Seda Erdem at Stirling University adds may ""report and relay"" updated information back to the shopper about their contents. And what about when it comes to manipulating the food itself? Research from several countries shows almost endless possibilities - to enhance the flavour and texture of foods, reduce fat content, or to encapsulate nutrients such as vitamins to ensure they do not degrade during a product's shelf life.In this area however, UK regulator, The Food Standards Agency in its latest report still seems a little queasy, taking a very a cautious stance as it remains unclear what the long-term impact of tinkering with these tiny building blocks could be on the rest of the food chain.

113,Inside the controversial US gunshot-detection firm,"ShotSpotter's incident-review room is like any other call centre. Analysts wearing headsets sit by computer screens, listening intently. Yet the people working here have an extraordinary responsibility. They make the final decision on whether a computer algorithm has correctly identified a gunshot - and whether to dispatch the police.Making the wrong call has serious consequences. ShotSpotter has garnered much negative press over the last year. Allegations range from its tech not being accurate, to claims that ShotSpotter is fuelling discrimination in the police. In the wake of those negative news stories, the company gave BBC News access to its national incident-review centre.ShotSpotter is trying to solve a genuine problem. ""What makes the system so compelling, we believe, is a full 80-95% of gunfire goes unreported,"" chief executive Ralph Clark says. People don't report gunshots for several reasons - they may be unsure what they have heard, think someone else will call 911 or simply lack trust in the police. So ShotSpotter's founders had an idea. What if they could bypass the 911 process altogether? They came up with a system. Microphones are fixed to structures around a neighbourhood. When a loud bang is detected, a computer analyses the sound and classifies it as either a gunshot or something else. A human analyst then steps in to review the decision.In the incident-review room, former teacher Ginger Ammon allows me to sit with her as she analyses these decisions in real time. Every time the algorithm flags a potential shot, it makes a ""ping"" sound. Ms Ammon first listens to the recording herself and then studies the waveform it produces on her computer screen.""We're looking to see how many sensors picked it up and if the sensors made a directional pattern, because, in theory, a gunshot can only travel in one direction,"" she says. Once confident a shot has been fired, Ms Ammon clicks a button that dispatches police officers to the scene. It all happens in under 60 seconds. ""It kind of feels like you're playing a computer game,"" I say. ""That is a comment that we get frequently,"" she replies. There are clear examples of ShotSpotter working. In April 2017, black supremacist Kori Ali Muhammad went on a murderous rampage in Fresno, California. Trying to kill as many white men as possible, he walked around a suburban neighbourhood, picking off targets. The police were receiving 911 calls - but they were delayed and unspecific. Yet ShotSpotter was able to indicate to officers Muhammad's route.After three minutes - and three murders - Muhammad was apprehended.Fresno police believe without ShotStopper, he would have killed more.""ShotSpotter gave us the path he took,"" says Lt Bill Dooley.The company has been hugely successful at convincing police forces to adopt its technology. Its microphones are in more than 100 cities across America - and for years, the technology was considered uncontroversial. That all changed with George Floyd's murder, as people became more interested in the technology so many police forces were using. ShotSpotter is too expensive for the police to roll out across a city. Instead, microphones are often placed in inner-city areas - areas with higher black populations.So if the technology isn't as accurate as claimed, it could be having a disproportionate impact on those communities.Suddenly, ShotSpotter was in the spotlight.ShotSpotter claims to be 97% accurate. That would mean that the police can be pretty confident that when a ShotSpotter alert happens - they are almost certainly responding to a gunshot. But that claim is exactly that, a claim. It's hard to see how ShotSpotter knows it's that accurate - at least not with the public information it has released.And if it isn't, it could have wide consequences for American justice. The first problem with that accuracy claim is that it's often difficult to tell, on the ground, whether a shot has been fired. When Chicago's Inspector General investigated, they found that in only 9% of ShotSpotter alerts was there any physical evidence of a gunshot. ""It's a low number,"" the city's Deputy Inspector General for Public Safety, Deborah Witzburgh, says.That means in 91% of police responses to ShotSpotter alerts, it's difficult to say definitively that a gun was fired. That's not to say there was no gunshot, but hard to prove that there was. Gunfire sounds very similar to a firecracker, or car backfiring. So how is ShotSpotter so confident that it's nearly 100% accurate? It's something I ask Mr Clark. ""We rely on ground truth from agencies to tell us when we miss, when we miss detections or when we miss-classify,"" he tells me. But critics say that methodology has a fundamental flaw. If the police are unsure whether a gunshot has been fired, they are not going to tell the company it was wrong. In other words, say critics, the company has been counting ""don't knows"", '""maybes"", and ""probablys"" as ""got it rights"". Chicago defence lawyer Brendan Max says the company's accuracy claims are ""marketing nonsense"".""Customer feedback is used to decide whether people like Pepsi or Coke better,"" he says.""It's not designed to determine whether a scientific method works.""Conor Healy, who analyses security systems for video-surveillance research group IPVM, is also deeply sceptical about the 97% accuracy figure.""Putting the onus on the police to report every false positive means you expect them to report on stuff, when nothing's happened… which they're unlikely to do,"" Mr Healy says.""It's fair to assume that if they [ShotSpotter] have solid testing data to back up their claims, they have every incentive to release that data."" Back in Fresno I join the police on a night-time ride-along with police officer Nate Palomino. Fresno has some of California's worst gun crime, and just like many other cities in America it's been getting worse in the last two years.Sure enough, a ShotSpotter alert comes through. However, when we reach the scene, no casings are found and there's no physical evidence of a gunshot.  Officer Palomino tells me the audio recording sounds like a gunshot - and it seems more than possible it was - but it's difficult to prove. He says that scenario is typical. ShotSpotter's accuracy should be beyond doubt.It has been used in courts up and down the country as evidence for both defence and prosecution. The worry is that if it isn't as accurate as is claimed, ShotSpotter is sending officers into situations wrongly expecting gunfire.Alyxander Godwin, who has been campaigning to get rid of ShotSpotter in Chicago, summarises the concern.""The police are expecting these situations to be hostile,"" she says. ""They expect there to be a gun, and because of where this is deployed, they're expecting a black or brown person to be holding a gun.""But ShotSpotter says there is no data to back this theory up. ""What you'd be describing is a situation where officers get to a scene and they're basically shooting unarmed people,"" Mr Clark says.""It's just not in the data - it's speculation.""Yet he seems to also accept that the company's own accuracy methodology has its limitations.""It might be a fair criticism to say, 'Hey, look, you're not getting all the feedback that you might possibly get,'"" Mr Clark says.""That might be a fair criticism."" Mr Max, the Chicago lawyer, says ShotSpotter reports should not be allowed as evidence in court until the company can better back up its claims. ""In the last four or five months, I'm aware of dozens of Chicagoans who have been arrested based on ShotSpotter evidence,"" he says.""I'm sure that has played out in cities across the country.""He also says the company should open its systems up to better review and analysis.For example, who is independently reviewing the quality of the analysts? And how often does the algorithm disagree with the human analyst? Certainly, from my time at the ShotSpotter incident review centre, it's common for analysts to disagree with the computer classification. ""It's just filtering out what we see,"" Ms Ammon says.""But I honestly don't even look at it [the classification], I'm so busy looking at the sensor patterns.""  It's an interesting admission. Sometimes, the technology is viewed as all seeing, all knowing - the computer masterfully detecting a gunshot. In practice, the analysts have a far greater role than I expected. Lawyers such as Brendan Max are interested in trying to establish more information about how the technology works in court. ShotSpotter has had a lot of criticism over the past year - not all of it fair. And much of the coverage casually skips over the fact that police forces often give glowing reviews of the technology's effectiveness.The company is keen to highlight cases where ShotSpotter has alerted police to gunshot victims, for example, saving lives. In several cities across America, activists are trying to persuade cities to pull ShotSpotter contracts. But in other places, ShotSpotter is expanding. In Fresno, police chief Paco Balderrama is looking to increase its coverage, at a cost of $1m (£0.7m) a year. ""What if ShotSpotter only saves one life in a given year? Is it worth a million dollars? I would argue it is,"" he says. The debate around ShotSpotter is hugely complex - and has important potential ramifications for community policing in America.It's unlikely to go away until the tech's accuracy is independently verified and the data peer reviewed.

114,Elon Musk holds Twitter vote over $21bn Tesla share sale,"Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has launched a Twitter poll of his 62.6 million followers asking if he should sell 10% of his shares.The vote, which closes later on Sunday, could see him dispose of $21bn (£16bn) of stock in the electric carmaker.He promised to abide by the result of the poll, a response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats.The plan could see Mr Musk, who is one of the world's richest men, face a huge tax bill.By mid-afternoon on Sunday, with about 3 hours to go before the poll closes, 57.2% of the 3.2 million respondents had voted ""yes"".The Tesla chief executive owns more than $200bn worth of shares and is due to exercise options next year that will boost his worth even further, but leave Mr Musk with what he said would be a ""massive"" tax bill.Under plans proposed by the Democratic Party in the Senate, billionaires could be taxed on ""unrealised gains"" when the price of their shares goes up - even if they do not sell any of their stock.In another tweet on Saturday, Mr Musk said: ""Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he tweeted.It is thought the proposed tax on capital gains, whether or not assets have been sold, could hit about 700 billionaires in the US.

116,Biden: Infrastructure bill is 'monumental step forward',"President Joe Biden has hailed the passage of his landmark $1tn (£741bn) infrastructure spending package as a ""monumental step forward"". Negotiations over the sweeping public works bill - which passed the House of Representatives with 228-206 vote - created a bitter split among Democrats.""Finally, infrastructure week,"" Mr Biden told reporters. ""I'm so happy to say that: infrastructure week.""A more ambitious social spending bill favoured by liberals was put on hold.The infrastructure package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law.Billed as a ""once-in-a-generation"" spending measure, the infrastructure legislation proposes $550bn in new federal expenditure, over the next eight years, to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks.The agreement also sets aside funding for clean drinking water, high speed internet, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging points.It is the largest federal investment in the country's infrastructure for decades and is seen as a major domestic win for the US president.""We took a monumental step forward as a nation"", Mr Biden told reporters. ""We did something that's long overdue... a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to create millions of jobs modernising infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our broadband, all range of things"". It will be financed in several ways, including unspent emergency relief funds from the Covid pandemic.Its passage marks a huge achievement for the Biden administration amid low approval ratings and a defeat for the Democrats in Virginia's gubernatorial election this week.Three months ago, 19 Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the legislation in the evenly split Senate, a rare bipartisan feat in an increasingly divided Congress.On Friday the bill passed the House with support from 13 Republicans, too. But more liberal lawmakers balked at its final version, complaining that key liberal policies had been dropped in exchange for the bipartisan win. Six Democrats voted against it, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The group of six - dubbed The Squad - are among the most left-wing and progressive members of the House.Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pledged they would not support the infrastructure bill until they had voted on a separate social welfare bill that allocates $1.75tn for healthcare, education and climate change initiatives.If passed, it would usher in the biggest expansion of the US safety net in more than 50 years.Democrats control both chambers of Congress by very slim majorities, so near-universal support would be required for the bill's passage.Centrist Democrats continue to object to the size and scope of the sprawling bill. They are insisting on seeing full accounting of its economic impacts.On Friday House leaders brokered a compromise, insisting on a vote on the infrastructure bill, accompanied by a procedural vote to start debate on the social spending bill. The chamber passed the procedural vote early on Saturday by 221 votes to 213.Compiling an independent assessment of the social spending bill's full cost is expected to take at least two weeks, although Democratic leaders have said they remain confident the bill will be passed before the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.After months of haggling, brinksmanship and trips back to square one, Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill is on the verge of becoming infrastructure law.Final passage in Congress was secured by a deal forged between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party to approve the infrastructure bill now and hold a vote in the House of Representatives on a larger social spending package by 15 November.That represents a leap of faith - and a tactical retreat - by the liberals who had been insisting that the infrastructure and spending bills be approved simultaneously. It was a leap too far for the handful of liberals who still voted no. But with a few Republicans on board, and Joe Biden publicly pushing for a vote and promising progressives the spending bill would get its day soon, a path to passage emerged.Of course, promises can be broken - and there's still the possibility centrists could derail the spending package, either in the House or after it reaches the Senate. In the meantime, however, the infrastructure bill, with hundreds of billions of dollars for roads, bridges, pipes and green energy, has reached the finish line, giving Mr Biden a signature bipartisan legislative victory.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3381/production/_121458131_hi070823987.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59192048,entertainment

118,US sees strong jobs growth as wages edge higher,"US employers hired more new workers in October than expected, after a slowdown in the summer.Firms added 531,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.6%, official figures showed.Hiring figures for September were also revised upwards.The spread of the Delta variant and slower growth had suppressed hiring over the summer, along with an apparent reluctance from parts of the workforce to return to work. That has left many employers scrambling for staff and struggling to meet growing demand. Many are raising wages to attract and retain staff. Figures from the Bureau for Labor Statistics showed average private sector wages rose modestly in October, by 11 cents, to $30.96 an hour, but the rise adds to six months of strong wage increases.The 4.9% growth in average earnings over the past year doesn't outpace annual inflation, which was running at 5.4% in September.Revised data for September showed that many more jobs were created that month, 312,000, than the 197,000 initially reported. Figures for August were also revised upwards from 366,000 to 483,000.There were notable gains in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing, the Bureau said.Taken together the data shows a strong upward trend, although jobs growth is still below the rates seen in the first half of the year.by Michelle Fleury, BBC business correspondentPresident Biden used the October jobs report to take a victory lap, pointing out that the recovery had been faster and stronger than predicted.He said unemployment had decreased this year more than in any year since 1950.The solid jobs report signals that the economic fallout from the Delta wave is finally receding after several months of disappointing data.Nowhere was that more apparent than in the leisure and hospitality sector which added 164,000 jobs.And the gains weren't limited to one industry. Across the private sector hiring was strong, including in professional and business services, and manufacturing.But there is still a large hole to dig out of.The country has more than four million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemicAnd the labour force participation rate - which measures the share of people who have jobs or are actively looking for work - is flat even as the economic rebound gains steam. A large number of workers who left the American job market during the pandemic, don't seem to be in a hurry to return. And it's not clear that they will.Today's report shows the US economy is picking up momentum. But with lingering supply chain issues and the unpredictability of the health crisis, whether this performance can be repeated remains anyone's guess.Analysts welcomed the report as a strong indication of post-pandemic recovery.""It shows that we're seeing the jobs market healing to the point where we could expect even larger gains next month as more people return to the labour force,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.However, the participation rate, which shows what proportion of potential workers are in jobs or looking for one, remained flat, suggesting not everyone is ready for a return to normal.""The participation rate idled at 61.6% which is consistent with people being hesitant about returning to the workforce,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.""The market wants to see people come off the sidelines and return to the labour force.""Fear of Covid infection, childcare challenges, relocations and other lifestyle changes have kept some people out of the labour market. With government support coming to an end, children back in school and savings made during the pandemic running down economists expect more people to return to work.There are currently 7.4 million people out of work, down sharply from its peak during the pandemic but above the 5.7 million who were looking for work pre-Covid.In February 2020, before the pandemic the unemployment rate was 3.5%.Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said it was ""a little mystifying"" why more people were not returning to the workforce.""At this point, with reduced benefits, a return to in-person schooling and the drop in Covid rates, we should be seeing a recovery in participation,"" she said.""Is it because the massive cushion of savings is still weighing on the incentive to return to work?

119,Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living,"The Bank of England governor has said he is ""very sorry"" that UK inflation is rising amid forecasts the cost of living could reach as much as 5%.Andrew Bailey told the BBC that households were already feeling the impact of rising prices. ""I'm very sorry that's happening,"" he said. ""None of us want to see that happen.""On Thursday, the Bank surprised financial markets by voting to keep the interest rate unchanged.  It signalled that the rate - currently at a historic low of 0.1% - will rise in the ""coming months"" as inflation is expected to grow.However, the majority of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to hold borrowing costs during November's meeting, in part to see how the jobs market had coped with the end of the furlough scheme.Inflation is currently ahead of the Bank of England's 2% target at 3.1%. There are expectations it could rise to 5% by next April.Mr Bailey said: ""Inflation is clearly something that bites on people's household income. I'm sure they're already feeling that in terms of prices that are going up.""But he said the Bank wanted to see what impact both domestic and global issues were having on the cost of living before deciding on whether to raise rates. Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global ""supply shocks"" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy.The Bank did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December. The MPC meets every six weeks. But commenting on the decision not to raise borrowing costs this month. Mr Bailey said: ""Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas.""Mr Bailey was criticised on Thursday by market analysts and some former members of the MPC for last month appearing to signal that the interest rate would soon rise, only for it to be held. The pound fell against the dollar by as much as 1.5% in reaction to the decision.The governor said in October that the Bank would ""have to act"" to curb accelerating inflation, though he did not give a timeframe for when rates might rise.Mr Bailey told the BBC that the Bank had been concerned that it was seeing evidence that inflation was rising during summer. ""We thought it was likely that rates would have to rise, I think it was necessary to give that warning,"" he said.However, he said that ""at no point"" did he or any member of the MPC say that the interest rate was going to rise in November.But Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC who is now an economics professor at Dartmouth College in the US, said the Bank should be wary of giving any forecast of where interest rates are going.""We have no historical precedent for what's happened,"" he said. ""We've never seen a shock of this kind and the big thing we are seeing at the moment is the furlough scheme is coming off, there is going to be an increase in taxes on National Insurance [and] universal credit was just cut.""So, the central bank really hasn't a lot of clue what is going on.""He said: ""This is a really big uncertain world and everybody should tread cautiously. I'm afraid I have to say...  you have to take what the governor of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee said with a very large pinch of salt.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1644E/production/_121441219_money.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59173293,entertainment

124,Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living,"The Bank of England governor has said he is ""very sorry"" that UK inflation is rising amid forecasts the cost of living could reach as much as 5%.Andrew Bailey told the BBC that households were already feeling the impact of rising prices. ""I'm very sorry that's happening,"" he said. ""None of us want to see that happen.""On Thursday, the Bank surprised financial markets by voting to keep the interest rate unchanged.  It signalled that the rate - currently at a historic low of 0.1% - will rise in the ""coming months"" as inflation is expected to grow.However, the majority of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to hold borrowing costs during November's meeting, in part to see how the jobs market had coped with the end of the furlough scheme.Inflation is currently ahead of the Bank of England's 2% target at 3.1%. There are expectations it could rise to 5% by next April.Mr Bailey said: ""Inflation is clearly something that bites on people's household income. I'm sure they're already feeling that in terms of prices that are going up.""But he said the Bank wanted to see what impact both domestic and global issues were having on the cost of living before deciding on whether to raise rates. Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global ""supply shocks"" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy.The Bank did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December. The MPC meets every six weeks. But commenting on the decision not to raise borrowing costs this month. Mr Bailey said: ""Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas.""Mr Bailey was criticised on Thursday by market analysts and some former members of the MPC for last month appearing to signal that the interest rate would soon rise, only for it to be held. The pound fell against the dollar by as much as 1.5% in reaction to the decision.The governor said in October that the Bank would ""have to act"" to curb accelerating inflation, though he did not give a timeframe for when rates might rise.Mr Bailey told the BBC that the Bank had been concerned that it was seeing evidence that inflation was rising during summer. ""We thought it was likely that rates would have to rise, I think it was necessary to give that warning,"" he said.However, he said that ""at no point"" did he or any member of the MPC say that the interest rate was going to rise in November.But Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC who is now an economics professor at Dartmouth College in the US, said the Bank should be wary of giving any forecast of where interest rates are going.""We have no historical precedent for what's happened,"" he said. ""We've never seen a shock of this kind and the big thing we are seeing at the moment is the furlough scheme is coming off, there is going to be an increase in taxes on National Insurance [and] universal credit was just cut.""So, the central bank really hasn't a lot of clue what is going on.""He said: ""This is a really big uncertain world and everybody should tread cautiously. I'm afraid I have to say...  you have to take what the governor of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee said with a very large pinch of salt.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1644E/production/_121441219_money.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59173293,entertainment
125,Biden: Infrastructure bill is 'monumental step forward',"President Joe Biden has hailed the passage of his landmark $1tn (£741bn) infrastructure spending package as a ""monumental step forward"". Negotiations over the sweeping public works bill - which passed the House of Representatives with 228-206 vote - created a bitter split among Democrats.""Finally, infrastructure week,"" Mr Biden told reporters. ""I'm so happy to say that: infrastructure week.""A more ambitious social spending bill favoured by liberals was put on hold.The infrastructure package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law.Billed as a ""once-in-a-generation"" spending measure, the infrastructure legislation proposes $550bn in new federal expenditure, over the next eight years, to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks.The agreement also sets aside funding for clean drinking water, high speed internet, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging points.It is the largest federal investment in the country's infrastructure for decades and is seen as a major domestic win for the US president.""We took a monumental step forward as a nation"", Mr Biden told reporters. ""We did something that's long overdue... a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to create millions of jobs modernising infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our broadband, all range of things"". It will be financed in several ways, including unspent emergency relief funds from the Covid pandemic.Its passage marks a huge achievement for the Biden administration amid low approval ratings and a defeat for the Democrats in Virginia's gubernatorial election this week.Three months ago, 19 Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the legislation in the evenly split Senate, a rare bipartisan feat in an increasingly divided Congress.On Friday the bill passed the House with support from 13 Republicans, too. But more liberal lawmakers balked at its final version, complaining that key liberal policies had been dropped in exchange for the bipartisan win. Six Democrats voted against it, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The group of six - dubbed The Squad - are among the most left-wing and progressive members of the House.Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pledged they would not support the infrastructure bill until they had voted on a separate social welfare bill that allocates $1.75tn for healthcare, education and climate change initiatives.If passed, it would usher in the biggest expansion of the US safety net in more than 50 years.Democrats control both chambers of Congress by very slim majorities, so near-universal support would be required for the bill's passage.Centrist Democrats continue to object to the size and scope of the sprawling bill. They are insisting on seeing full accounting of its economic impacts.On Friday House leaders brokered a compromise, insisting on a vote on the infrastructure bill, accompanied by a procedural vote to start debate on the social spending bill. The chamber passed the procedural vote early on Saturday by 221 votes to 213.Compiling an independent assessment of the social spending bill's full cost is expected to take at least two weeks, although Democratic leaders have said they remain confident the bill will be passed before the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.After months of haggling, brinksmanship and trips back to square one, Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill is on the verge of becoming infrastructure law.Final passage in Congress was secured by a deal forged between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party to approve the infrastructure bill now and hold a vote in the House of Representatives on a larger social spending package by 15 November.That represents a leap of faith - and a tactical retreat - by the liberals who had been insisting that the infrastructure and spending bills be approved simultaneously. It was a leap too far for the handful of liberals who still voted no. But with a few Republicans on board, and Joe Biden publicly pushing for a vote and promising progressives the spending bill would get its day soon, a path to passage emerged.Of course, promises can be broken - and there's still the possibility centrists could derail the spending package, either in the House or after it reaches the Senate. In the meantime, however, the infrastructure bill, with hundreds of billions of dollars for roads, bridges, pipes and green energy, has reached the finish line, giving Mr Biden a signature bipartisan legislative victory.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3381/production/_121458131_hi070823987.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59192048,entertainment
126,US Virgin Islands probes Barclays Epstein links,"The US Virgin Islands has served Barclays in the UK with a court order to provide any documents linked to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The US territory is seeking information on transactions, correspondence and investments linked to the financier.The bank was subpoenaed in New York on the matter in February this year.A Barclays spokesperson said: ""Barclays has already provided its response to this subpoena and complied with its obligations. ""The US Virgin Islands is now in the process of serving a similar subpoena on Barclays in the UK and Barclays will respond to that subpoena once it is served.""The BBC understands there is no link between the subpoena and Jes Staley's recent shock resignation as Barclays chief executive, or the FCA probe into his links to Mr Epstein.Following the conclusion of the investigation, Mr Staley left his job suddenly this week after more than six years at Barclays.It had focussed on Mr Staley's links with the dead financier and whether they were closer than first thought.Barclays said on Monday it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"".The subpoena served on Barclays in the US asked for a wide range of documents including any communications between Mr Staley and Epstein, details of the bank's investigation into Epstein and Staley, and Barclays' decision to hire Mr Staley.The US Virgin Islands attempted to serve the second subpoena on Barclays at its London offices in September, but this needs High Court approval, which lawyers for the US territory are understood to be seeking.Mr Staley left his job as Barclays boss after a shock resignation this week, apparently over a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by regulators.Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional.The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14965/production/_121452348_gettyimages-1180284207.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59180577,entertainment
127,US sees strong jobs growth as wages edge higher,"US employers hired more new workers in October than expected, after a slowdown in the summer.Firms added 531,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.6%, official figures showed.Hiring figures for September were also revised upwards.The spread of the Delta variant and slower growth had suppressed hiring over the summer, along with an apparent reluctance from parts of the workforce to return to work. That has left many employers scrambling for staff and struggling to meet growing demand. Many are raising wages to attract and retain staff. Figures from the Bureau for Labor Statistics showed average private sector wages rose modestly in October, by 11 cents, to $30.96 an hour, but the rise adds to six months of strong wage increases.The 4.9% growth in average earnings over the past year doesn't outpace annual inflation, which was running at 5.4% in September.Revised data for September showed that many more jobs were created that month, 312,000, than the 197,000 initially reported. Figures for August were also revised upwards from 366,000 to 483,000.There were notable gains in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing, the Bureau said.Taken together the data shows a strong upward trend, although jobs growth is still below the rates seen in the first half of the year.by Michelle Fleury, BBC business correspondentPresident Biden used the October jobs report to take a victory lap, pointing out that the recovery had been faster and stronger than predicted.He said unemployment had decreased this year more than in any year since 1950.The solid jobs report signals that the economic fallout from the Delta wave is finally receding after several months of disappointing data.Nowhere was that more apparent than in the leisure and hospitality sector which added 164,000 jobs.And the gains weren't limited to one industry. Across the private sector hiring was strong, including in professional and business services, and manufacturing.But there is still a large hole to dig out of.The country has more than four million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemicAnd the labour force participation rate - which measures the share of people who have jobs or are actively looking for work - is flat even as the economic rebound gains steam. A large number of workers who left the American job market during the pandemic, don't seem to be in a hurry to return. And it's not clear that they will.Today's report shows the US economy is picking up momentum. But with lingering supply chain issues and the unpredictability of the health crisis, whether this performance can be repeated remains anyone's guess.Analysts welcomed the report as a strong indication of post-pandemic recovery.""It shows that we're seeing the jobs market healing to the point where we could expect even larger gains next month as more people return to the labour force,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.However, the participation rate, which shows what proportion of potential workers are in jobs or looking for one, remained flat, suggesting not everyone is ready for a return to normal.""The participation rate idled at 61.6% which is consistent with people being hesitant about returning to the workforce,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.""The market wants to see people come off the sidelines and return to the labour force.""Fear of Covid infection, childcare challenges, relocations and other lifestyle changes have kept some people out of the labour market. With government support coming to an end, children back in school and savings made during the pandemic running down economists expect more people to return to work.There are currently 7.4 million people out of work, down sharply from its peak during the pandemic but above the 5.7 million who were looking for work pre-Covid.In February 2020, before the pandemic the unemployment rate was 3.5%.Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said it was ""a little mystifying"" why more people were not returning to the workforce.""At this point, with reduced benefits, a return to in-person schooling and the drop in Covid rates, we should be seeing a recovery in participation,"" she said.""Is it because the massive cushion of savings is still weighing on the incentive to return to work? Or is there a fundamental shift in the psychology of working?"" Until more workers return ""supply chain issues will only linger"", she added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1EA5/production/_118954870_gettyimages-1266672254.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59166014,entertainment

129,Kaisa Group: Missed payment triggers fresh China property fears,"Fresh concerns have been raised about China's property sector as Kaisa Group has become the latest developer to miss a payment to investors.Kaisa said it was facing unprecedented pressure on its finances due to a challenging property market.It comes as rival developer Evergrande Group is still reeling under the weight of more than $300bn (£222bn) of debt. The crisis at Evergrande has triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets.Meanwhile, Evergrande has sold a UK-based asset as it faces another payment deadline on Saturday.Trading in shares of Kaisa Group and three of its units was halted in Hong Kong on Friday, after one of its businesses missed a payment on a wealth management product.Friday's filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange did not give a reason for the trading suspension.Before the suspension, Kaisa, which has a market value of about $1bn, saw its shares hit a record low on Thursday after falling by 15%.The Shenzhen-based developer said on Thursday that it is facing unprecedented pressure on its finances due to a challenging property market and downgrades by rating agencies, which makes it more difficult for it to borrow money.Evergrande has been the most high profile example of China's debt crisis but there are others in the property sector with similar issues. Their total combined debt is estimated to be more than $5tn, according to Japanese banking giant Nomura. That's almost the size of Japan's economy. Fantasia, Sinic and China Properties Group have all defaulted on debts in recent months while Kaisa has become the latest developer to miss a payment.Beijing has restricted how much these developers can borrow and it has proposed introducing a local property tax but the move is controversial because local governments rely on land sales for their revenues. However, investors and economists are worried that the financial issues faced by these developers will make consumers even more reluctant to buy property in an economy where real estate has been a major driver for growth.On Saturday, an Evergrande unit is due to make $82.5m of interest payments to investors, while next Wednesday a 30-day grace period expires for other interest payments owed by the embattled property developer.Evergrande's shares were suspended in Hong Kong for 17 days last month after the company requested a trading halt ahead of the announcement of a major transaction.However, a plan to sell a large stake in its property services unit for $2.6bn fell through as it was unable to agree the terms of the deal.On Thursday, Evergrande's vehicle manufacturing unit sold its UK-based electric motor making business Protean as it tries to raise funds to meet its obligations.Evergrande didn't say how much it was paid for Protean, which it bought in 2019 for $58m.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/95A0/production/_121440383_tv071612223.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59159371,entertainment
130,"Inflation: Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says","Global food prices have hit the highest level in over a decade after rising by more than 30% in the last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says.The agency's figures highlighted the soaring cost of cereals and vegetable oils around the world.Vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October.Disruptions to supplies, high commodity prices, factory closures and political tensions are helping to push up prices.The FAO said its measure of cereal prices was up by more than 22% compared to a year earlier.The price of wheat was one of the major contributors to this rise, up almost 40% in the last 12 months after major exporters - such as Canada, Russia and the US - had poor harvests. ""In the case of cereals, we're facing a situation where one could say it's climate change which is ultimately causing falling production,"" Peter Batt, an agribusiness expert at Curtin Business School told the BBC.""We've had pretty bad years [of harvests] in a lot of places."" The FAO said its index of vegetable oil prices was pushed up by rises in the cost of palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils. In the case of palm oil, prices have been driven higher after output from Malaysia was ""subdued"" due to ongoing shortages of migrant workers, the FAO said.Labour shortages are helping to push up the cost of production and transportation of food in other parts of the world too.Mr Batt said: ""The other problem that has emerged is getting the product out. For example, here in Australia we've had a lot of ships arrive to take the food away but we can't get crew to come in because of Covid.""Shipping disruptions are also pushing up milk prices, with the cost of dairy products rising by almost 16% over the last year.Brigit Busicchia from Macquarie University said speculation on global markets is also contributing to price volatility: ""Since the 1990s, the deregulation of commodity futures trading has made it possible for institutional investors to enter this market on a large scale.""This is having a particular impact on countries which rely on food imports.""Expect countries like Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries to experience tensions in their provisioning of cereals,"" she said.Ms Busicchia also highlighted that rising food prices are typically felt most acutely by the poor, as disadvantaged groups are pushed further into poverty and that this has the potential to heighten social and political tensions.

131,The Bank of England says cutting carbon could push up prices,"The governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey does not just have rising prices on his mind this week. He was a delegate at the COP26 climate change talks, and central bankers like him have a big role in the ""rewiring"" of the financial system to achieve net zero.But in fact there is a connection between these two worlds, says Governor Bailey himself. In an interview with me the governor says that the transition to net zero ""could lead to permanent price level effects"", that we have to ""understand and deal with"". Mr Bailey said people should ""understand that this is the transition path we have to do"".Indeed he went further, saying: ""I think we are already seeing some effects from climate change on prices now"". In particular he said ""a bit of the gas price story"" - a reference to the 400% increase in prices over the past year - is the result of the world at the same time, shunning coal and chasing the same scarce natural gas supplies.""As we substitute out of more damaging hydrocarbons, coal obviously being a case in point, during the transition, we will probably see increased demand for some other hydrocarbons [i.e. gas].""Given that many political voices have tiptoed around the issue that the climate change transition being discussed in Glasgow is likely to have an impact on consumers, this would appear a significant statement of the reality. It is of clear interest to an institution which is required in law to model, forecast and ultimately to control inflation.The transition to a renewable economy will mean a higher level of prices in a long run transition period. The Bank's modelling suggests that unmitigated climate change will also harm the fabric of the economy. But the governor believes while it is vital to recognise the economic benefits of saving the planet, it is also necessary that the public has a clear map on the economics of the climate transition.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/670F/production/_121438362_gettyimages-1304209461.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59172004,entertainment
132,Taxi driver shortage prompts public safety fears,"More than half of licensed mini-cab taxi drivers have not returned to the trade since the pandemic, an industry group has said.The Licensed Private Hire Car Association (LPHCA) estimates the industry is short of 160,000 of the previously 300,000-strong workforce. Many drivers left the industry during lockdowns as demand plummeted. The shortage has prompted concerns over the safety of women, students and night time workers struggling to get home. A backlog in costly licensing and registration of vehicles, as well as criminal and medical checks for drivers, have led to what the LPHCA have called ""a perfect storm"". A mini-cab driver must apply to their local council for a licence, which can cost up to £600 a year. Drivers must also obtain a criminal record check and a full medical check, as well as the famous ""Knowledge"" examination in some cases.""This is a real national problem that affects everywhere,"" said Steve Wright, chairman of the LPHCA. ""We have had calls from Inverness in Scotland, right down to Cornwall, with people saying they cannot get drivers and they cannot get licences quickly enough,"" he told the BBC. It is leaving thousands of customers in the lurch. Taxis provide a vital service; taking people to hospital appointments, back from the shops and of course safely home after an evening out. Taz Harrison, Welfare Officer at The Sugarmill in Stoke-on-Trent, said she was worried about both staff and customers getting a ride. ""I am finishing at the club at 4am and waiting until 5am or 6am in the morning to get a taxi,"" she explained. ""It's a long time to be stood by yourself in town - pre-pandemic it was 5-10 minutes.""""I've worked in venues for 20 years and I've never known it this bad."" The Sugarmill is emptying its doors of 600 music fans at the same time as multiple venues across Hanley do the same. ""The majority of people are giving up and walking,"" Ms Harrison added. Students at Staffordshire University are unsurprised by this. ""There's no taxis anywhere, or they're all dodgy,"" one student explained. ""You get in and they want the money before you go anywhere,"" she continued.  The student's friend also shared their experience: ""A taxi driver let another guy get in a taxi with me when I finished work and he was flat out drunk - I was like, no!"" Another student explained she asked her Mum and Dad for a lift instead. The National Union of Students said some universities were partnering with taxi firms to create safer routes to students. However, the union urged the government to do more.""This is a public safety issue, and it vital that we address it now so that we stop seeing students stranded in unknown areas,"" said Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, vice president for higher education. In the current climate, of heightened safety concerns, especially for women, news of this shortage is particularly worrying. A few hours wait or a walk home on a balmy summer's evening may seem less of a problem than on a cold, dark, winter's night. As long queues grow in many towns waiting for the only available taxis, tempers fray and those travelling alone become even more vulnerable. The taxi shortage is impacting every corner of the UK. Some rural pubs, are already reporting that customers are being put off coming out when they know they'll struggle to get home. In bigger cities the shortage has been masked for a while by app services like Uber, but now people are experiencing longer waits, cancelled trips, and sky-high surcharging as drivers have more work than they can cover at any time of the day. One council taking a proactive approach to tackle the shortage is Torbay in Devon, where they have slashed the cost of licensing to just £50 to get more drivers behind the wheel. ""We were seeing massive queues for cabs and the tourist trade was being affected, so we thought we'd better step in,"" explained councillor Christine Carter.""In the summer, we had taxi marshals to help people, and we are going to do that again at Christmas to make it as safe as possible."" However Torbay's approach has only provided half of the drivers they need so far.""All we can keep doing is keep saying, 'please, please apply',"" Councillor Carter added. The Night Time Industries Association said the issue raises concerns over transport infrastructure. The association's chief executive Michael Kill said he was alarmed by the driver shortage and called for it to be prioritised by the government and city leaders across the country.""With a focus on vulnerability, and the safety of women at night, and thousands of night workers across the country, we cannot underestimate the vital role these services play in keeping people safe at night,"" Mr Kill added. A spokesperson from the Department for Transport responded: ""While provision of taxi licences is the responsibility of Local Authorities, we continue to work with industry groups to address concerns over potential shortages.""""Throughout the pandemic we have supported private hire vehicle drivers through grants from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,"" the spokesperson added. The Department for Transport also plans to revise licensing guidelines, but consultations on this will not happen until next year.

133,India cuts fuel taxes as prices hit record highs,"India has cut the taxes paid by consumers on petrol and diesel after the surging cost of crude oil pushed fuel prices to record highs.The decision aims to ease price rises and ""further spur the overall economic cycle"", the government said.Global commodity prices have soared this year as economies around the world recover from the pandemic.However, the move is also expected to boost demand for fuel as countries try to curb fossil fuel consumption.India's excise duty on petrol has been reduced by 5 rupees (£0.049; $0.0671) per litre, and by 10 rupees on diesel.""The reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel will also boost consumption and keep inflation low, thus helping the poor and middle classes,"" the government statement said.Following the federal government's announcement, at least ten states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), or his allies, said they would go further and cut local fuel taxes by as much as another 7 rupees a litre.The announcements came on the eve of the festival of Diwali, which sees the start of a busy festive season in India, typically marked by increased consumer spending.The tax cut is also likely to help ease the pressure on manufacturers and farmers, who have seen their overheads pushed up by rising fuel costs.Global oil prices have jumped this year, which has hit India hard as it typically imports around 85% of the oil it consumes. This has helped push up petrol and diesel prices to record levels.Reducing diesel prices has been one of the key demands from the country's farmers, who for more than a year have held a series of major protests. The government statement said that cutting the tax on diesel ""will come as a boost to the farmers during the upcoming Rabi season"".Rabi crops - such as wheat, barley and mustard - are typically sown after the monsoon season in mid-November.However, the tax cuts are also expected to increase consumption of petrol and diesel even as global leaders, including Mr Modi, have been gathering for the COP26 climate change conference to tackle the global economy's reliance on fossil fuels.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F638/production/_121323036_gettyimages-1236065178.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59129472,entertainment

The site in question - Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire - is owned and run by the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust.After six months of working for free, while he lived off savings, he was given a paid, entry-level role as an aviculturist (someone who looks after birds). Now a year later, he says he has never looked back.Mr Rochefort has had to take a substantial cut in pay, but he says he has never felt better. ""The change to my income hasn't affected my lifestyle at all, the only differences are my improved happiness and the size of mortgage I can apply for.""The pandemic has made a great many of us think of following in Mr Rochefort's footsteps, and make a career change, as a number of studies have shown.In the UK, three fifths of UK workers intend to switch to a different job as a result of Covid, according to a report earlier this year by insurance group Aviva. It is a similar picture in the US, where a survey from last month said that half of all workers wanted to make a change in career. Some commentators have called it ""the great resignation"".Mr Rochefort is also far from alone in wanting to switch to working in the great outdoors.The UK's Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which helps train the professional gardeners of the future, says that demand for its work-based training programmes has jumped 58% in 2021, the highest rate of increase for decades.Sharnee Gardner is one such RHS horticultural apprentice, after swapping life as a professional model to become a gardener.""I absolutely loved my modelling job - I flew [around] the world - but I was so absorbed in my work that I hardly spent time in nature anymore,"" says the 23-year-old.Covid travel bans meant Ms Gardner could no longer go abroad for modelling work from her home in London, so she decided it was time for a change.Now, Ms Gardner, who grew up in Australia, is studying horticulture at RHS site Garden Wisely in Surrey, where she spends her time cutting lawns, pruning trees and planting beds.""Working at the RHS has given me an opportunity to slow down and appreciate my surroundings,"" she says. ""I love watching the sunrise over the garden. It's very important to me to do something that makes me happy.The significant decrease in wage was definitely worth it because I love what I do. But to get by, my partner and I got a flat mate, and I still do the occasional modelling job, too.""The RHS has long pointed to research that shows how gardening contributes to a person's wellbeing, lowering stress levels, and helping people feel happier and healthier.And while most gardeners obviously only do it as a hobby, Suzanne Moss, the RHS's head of education and learning, says the pastime has proved to be especially beneficial throughout the pandemic. ""During the lockdowns, people formed new relationships with their gardens.""They were no longer places of weeds and work. They became a refuge.""This sentiment is echoed by Viren Swami, professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University. He is co-author of a report called Emotional Well-Being Under Conditions of Lockdown, which found that people who spent more time outside during the pandemic were happier than those who remained mostly indoors.""Pre-pandemic we know that people were spending more time indoors than ever before in human history,"" says Prof Swami. ""The more time spent outdoors, the more you'll feel the restorative effects. Beyond mental and physical health, being outdoors improves imagination and learning, and increases creativity and the feeling of fulfilment.""Ms Moss adds that the increased interest in becoming a professional gardener comes as the pandemic has highlighted the fragility of nature in general. ""Many people have realised how important it is not only to protect our own health, but the environment's too,"" she says.The horticulture sector is worth £24bn to the UK economy, according to the RHS, which only sees that increasing as firms in all sectors realise the importance of making their outdoor spaces greener.""Horticulture is a specialism that businesses are crying out for,"" says Ms Moss. ""We need people who can help industries adapt for sustainability.""Yet could the increased interest in gardening only be temporary? That is the suggestion of a report earlier this year by University College London.It found that a third of UK people were now doing less gardening and DIY than they were during the first lockdown of 2020. However, this may be because the weather was much better during spring and early summer last year. Lois O'Connell does not let cold temperatures or rain put her off her gardening work. ""It surprised me how much I loved gardening through the winter months,"" said the 29-year-old RHS student.Before the pandemic she was a sales manager for a luxury gin brand. She spent a lot of time sitting at her desk, or driving to and from meetings, which exacerbated the shoulder and back pain she already suffered from. Then Ms O'Connell was put on furlough.""I needed a change,"" she says. ""I started gardening for friends, then got part-time work with a garden maintenance company.""Ms O'Connell is now also working and studying at RHS Garden Wisley. ""When the days are short, it's good to catch all the daylight you can,"" she adds.""I've never felt better. My pain has gone. I feel calm when I'm gardening. This is definitely a change for life.""Back in Gloucestershire, Mr Rochefort says he has never been happier.  ""When I come home from work I'm physically exhausted and grinning from ear-to-ear,"" he says.""It gets to 10pm and I'm out like a light. I've never slept better.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C18F/production/_121315594_20211009_152208.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59132672,entertainment
135,Why free nursery childcare can come with costly extras,"Roxie Broun from East Sussex was looking forward to her three-year-old son receiving his 30 hours of government-funded childcare at nursery. Yet, although the Department for Education's (DfE) early years policy offers 15 or 30 hours of childcare for children aged three to four in England (there are differences in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) her nursery asked her to pay for a variety of extras.""We thought we would receive free funded hours but they weren't free at all. Our monthly household outgoings were higher than our combined income,"" says Ms Broun. ""I couldn't have gone back to work full-time even if I wanted to, and my part-time earnings only just covered the cost of top-up fees. ""If the government says they are going to fund 30-hours-a-week childcare, then surely that's what they should do. Top-up fees shouldn't exist,"" she says.Ms Broun isn't alone, many families are weighing up how to pay for childcare: a recent survey of 20,000 working parents  revealed 97% thought the cost of childcare in the UK was too expensive. Critics of Rishi Sunak's October Budget say it failed to include measures specifically targeted at helping young families to stay afloat and afford childcare, although he did announce extra support as part of a £500m package that, among other measures, will create a network of 75 family hubs across England. Meanwhile, government guidance states top-up fees - the difference between the nursery's normal fee and funding received from the local authority - cannot be charged for. But nurseries are allowed to ask for payments from parents and carers for nappies, snacks, nappy-creams and extra-curricular activities such as a music class or yoga - and this is a way of bridging the funding gap. When a child attends a nursery, the DfE says all invoices must be itemised so parents know exactly what charges they are paying for.The DfE says all charges are voluntary, so the choice to pay top-up fees is optional. It says parents should be told that they can supply their own snacks and nappies or join activities without purchasing any extras - ensuring their childcare is entirely free.However, many nurseries and childcare centres do not make this clear and parents can end up paying thousands of pounds a year.At present there is no universal policy on how the government's early years funded hours can be delivered completely free - and parents face a wide range of fees and top-up expenses across childcare centres. Some even ask parents to sign a contract stating that they will not take any legal action against the nursery for charging top-up fees - and in some cases fees can reach up to £9,000 per year.Joeli Brealey from women's charity, Pregnant Then Screwed, says conversations about top-up fees often create stress and tension between parents and childcare providers. But she acknowledges nurseries often have little choice, ""as their costs are more than the funding provided by the government.""However, the Department for Education says that the scheme, which sees some 202,000 children in England take-up a place each year, is beneficial for children.""The free entitlements are helping thousands of children, so we consider it's working well. Even during the pandemic the majority of eligible children have continued to access free places,"" the spokesperson says. ""We are not aware of any significant issues and we work closely with councils to ensure this.""However, Joeli Brealey rejects this, saying that a recent Freedom of Information request conducted by the Early Years Alliance which represents childcare providers, has shown that the government ""purposefully underfunded the scheme"".""Ultimately, this has forced thousands of mothers out of the workforce and will reduce the quality of childcare, with providers in areas of deprivation worse affected.""Ms Brealey doubts Rishi Sunak's measures will go far enough. ""Any investment in the sector is very welcome, but with a funding deficit of £662m in 2019/20, they are not tackling the current issues within our childcare sector.""Hundreds of thousands of mothers are still priced out of work, or are forced to work fewer hours, due to childcare cost and availability.""When Lucy Murray from Newport Pagnell, tried to understand more about the costs at her daughter's nursery she found the process was neither clear nor simple. She thought her daughter's childcare would be free, but instead, her monthly bill was only discounted from £600 to £400.""My daughter attended only 22 hours instead of the 30 hours but I was told we still had to pay fees. I asked for them to explain the top-up fees but was made to feel like I was being difficult. I felt embarrassed so I didn't probe further.""June O' Sullivan, who runs the London Early Years Foundation, a chain of 42 nurseries, says these funding challenges need to be addressed for both families and nurseries. ""The money from the government is supposed to cover everything, but they recognise that staffing is about 72% of your costs. So there is often a shortfall.""Ultimately, we should be targeting children that are going to need it most, and make it manageable for all families, [but] it's a conversation that isn't happening."" ""Many providers report that an increase of funding would be welcomed by the sector but all nurseries in receipt of funding have to offer the 15 or 30 hours free at the point of delivery,"" says Ms O'Sullivan.So where do parents looking for nursery funding go from here?In a landmark case earlier this year, Damian Roche challenged his nursery at Kiddi Caru in Market Harborough, after they had charged him the difference between the government's fee and their own without showing any clear charging structure.When he couldn't see what he had been paying for, he went through a two-stage complaint with his local council, Leicester City, and then took it to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsmen (LGO).The LGO found the nursery had charged top-up fees that were unlawful, and consequently Mr Roche was refunded more than £1,000. After investigation, a further 79 parents were refunded.The LGO says that if nurseries choose to participate in the early years funding they must meet minimum standards: ""The local authority pays the nursery directly. Parents must be able to take up their place entirely free of charge.""While this case was the first of its kind, it was not much use to Roxie Broun who after asking her nursery to work out how much her bill would be increased by, admitted she was still confused by it.She says it highlights the fact that government funding can fall far short of what nurseries require to operate. She is concerned any gap will end up being met by parents of younger children who are not entitled to funding.""It seems this is a problem across the board. Parents who have kids under three will end up paying even more, and they are the ones who already struggle the most with the cost of childcare.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31E0/production/_120386721_roxiebroun-01.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58242686,entertainment
136,CEO Secrets: 'Company culture shouldn't be too nice',"When Tamara Littleton started her company, The Social Element, she was determined to make it a friendly place to work. However, one big setback for the business taught her that if a working atmosphere is too cordial, it may deter staff from telling each other when they are making mistakes.""You can't be too nice,"" she says. ""You have to allow for people to challenge you."" The Social Element is an agency which helps corporations connect with consumers on social media.""What we provide is partly marketing, partly public relations and partly customer care,"" says Tamara. She founded the firm in 2003, when social media was in its infancy. Now it operates across the world, has an annual turnover of £9.2m a year and represents brands such as Oreo, Peloton, HSBC and Nissan.Tamara citers the positive working culture at The Social Element as one of the reasons for its success.""I wanted people to be able to bring their best self to work,"" she says. ""It's very collaborative. It's very agile. It's very high on communication, as well, and it's created this sort of family culture. It's helped keep staff in the company.""In 2014, with the business soaring in Europe and North America, Tamara decided to expand into the Asia-Pacific region. She chose Sydney in Australia as the base for operations. ""I felt that starting up an office in Australia would be a great next move for us,"" she says. ""We would be able to capture the Australian market and use it as a hub into Asia, as well. ""Essentially, I went with my gut. I'm quite an optimistic person and I just wanted to go for it. Everyone in the executive team went along with the idea.""However, after a few months, Tamara had to abandon Sydney as a base and write off the scheme as a failure.""Australian companies we brought on board were focused very much on the Australian market itself, and it wasn't the springboard into Asia that we'd been hoping for,"" she says. ""In retrospect, we should have gone to Hong Kong or Singapore.""Afterwards, she learnt that many people on the executive team who had supported her idea had privately doubted it would be a success.""They had been swept along by my optimism and positivity,"" says Tamara. ""But when we pulled out of Australia in the end, the executive team actually shared with me that they weren't 100% behind me. ""It was then that I realised that I had created this environment where it was all about being positive and optimistic, and they didn't want to be the negative person in the room, ruining it for everybody.""Tamara says she had to re-think her company culture. The danger of having a cordial atmosphere, she says, was that it had bred what she calls ""toxic positivity"". ""I had created a cordial culture,"" she says, ""but I wondered whether that culture had been responsible for everyone agreeing to a bad decision. The ethos was, if anything, a little too nice. ""I decided that we really needed to focus on a new element, 'healthy conflict', where people are allowed to challenge each other in order to move forward in the best way for the company.Tamara says that atmosphere in her firm is still convivial, ""but now it's much more honest"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10ED3/production/_121313396_copyoftamaralittletonandashleycooksley-signboard2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59134371,entertainment
137,Why Africa urgently needs its own genetic library,"It was just a ""crazy idea"" to start with, says Ambroise Wonkam, professor of medical genetics at Cape Town university in South Africa.He is talking about his vision of creating a huge library of genetic information about the population of Africa, outlined in the science journal Nature, earlier this year.The Three Million African Genomes (3MAG) project emerged from his work on how genetic mutations among Africans contribute to conditions like sickle-cell disease and hearing impairments. He points out that African genes hold a wealth of genetic variation, beyond that observed by scientists in Europe and elsewhere.""We are all African but only a small fraction of Africans moved out of Africa about 20-40,000 years ago and settled in Europe and in Asia,"" he says.Prof Wonkam is also concerned about equity. ""Too little of the knowledge and applications from genomics have benefited the global south because of inequalities in health-care systems, a small local research workforce and lack of funding,"" he says.Only about 2% of the genomes mapped globally are African, and a good proportion of these are African American. This comes from a lack of prioritising funding, policies and training infrastructure, he says, but it also means the understanding of genetic medicine as a whole is lopsided. Studies of African genomes will also help to correct injustices, he says: ""Estimates of genetic risk scores for people of African descent that predict, say, the likelihood of cardiomyopathies or schizophrenia can be unreliable or even misleading using tools that work well in Europeans.""To address these inequities, Prof Wonkam and other scientists are talking to governments, companies and professional bodies across Africa and internationally, in order to build up capacity over the next decade to make the vision a reality. The number of three million is the minimum he expects to accurately map genetic variations across Africa. As a comparison, the UK Biobank currently aims to sequence half a million genomes in under three years, but   the UK's 68 million population is just a fraction of Africa's 1.3 billion. Prof Wonkam says the project will take 10 years, and will cost around $450m (£335m) per year, and says  industry is already showing an interest in it.Biotech firms say they welcome any expansion of the library of African genomes.The Centre for Proteomic and Genomic Research (CPGR) in Cape Town works with biotech firm Artisan Biomed on a variety of diagnostic tests.  The firm says it is affected by the gaps in the availability of genomic information relevant to local populations.For example, it may find a genetic mutation in someone and not know for certain if that variation is associated with a disease, especially as a marker for that particular population.""The more information you have at that level, the better the diagnosis, treatment and eventually care can be for any individual, regardless of your ethnicity,"" says Dr Lindsay Petersen, chief operations officer.More Technology of BusinessArtisan Biomed says the data it collects feeds back into CPGR's research - allowing them to design a better diagnostic toolkit that is better suited to African populations, for instance.""Because of the limited data sets of the African genome, it needs that hand in hand connection with research and innovation, because without that it's just another test that has been designed for a Caucasian population that may or may not have much of an effect within the African populations,"" says Dr Judith Hornby Cuff. She says the 3MAG project would help streamline processes and improve the development of research, and perhaps one day provide cheaper, more effective and more accessible health care, particularly in the strained South African system. One of those hoping to take part in the 3MAG project is Dr Aron Abera, genomics scientist at Inqaba Biotech in Pretoria, which offers genetic sequencing and other services to research and industry.The firm employs over 100 people in South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Currently, most of the genetics samples collected in these countries are still processed in South Africa, but Dr Abera hopes to increase the number of laboratories soon.The gaps are not only in infrastructure, but also in staff. Over the last 20 years, Inqaba has focused on using staff and interns from the African continent - but it now has to expand its training programme as well.Back in Cape Town, Prof Wonkam says that while the costs are huge, the project will ""improve capacity in a whole range of biomedical disciplines that will equip Africa to tackle public-health challenges more equitably"".He says: ""We have to be ambitious when we are in Africa. You have so many challenges you cannot see small, you have to see big - and really big.""Additional reporting by Tim Bowler",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11792/production/_120807517_wonkam2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58788040,entertainment
138,My Money: 'It feels like a luxury to shop for non-essential items',"My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here, Sarah, 31 from Kent talks us through her weekly spending as the UK emerges from its third national lockdown.Sarah lives with her three-year-old daughter Annie, who attends nursery while Sarah works from home.Sarah works as a team manager in social care where she recently received a promotion. The increased salary has allowed her to spend more during her week.Over to Sarah...Monday morning and the start of a new week. I have back-to-back meetings but halfway through the day my cleaner arrives which feels very exciting after nearly four months of lockdown. When I was promoted to a management role in early March 2020, I decided to hire a cleaner as a gift to myself - so that I would be able to spend my weekends focused on my daughter instead of doing housework.She has been able to come periodically throughout the year, when restrictions were eased, but now that Lockdown Three has ended and restrictions are easing, I've asked her to come back every week for an hour. It's £12 an hour and she does a wonderful job, and it gives me peace of mind knowing that I can focus on quality time with Annie at the weekends instead of mopping the kitchen floor!While the rest of the country hit the shops for the first time since December, I sat at my laptop for the entire day, so no other spending for me today. My internet direct debit comes out today though (£24.45) so my total spend for the day is £36.45Total spend: £36.45More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series:We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk and we'll aim to contact you.Apart from the nursery drop off and pick up, I don't leave the house today.As a social work team manager, my days are full on, but I know it's important to manage my time well and I try to make sure that I take my lunch break most days and whenever possible I go for a quick walk around the block.I use my lunchtime choosing my meals for next week's meal plan box. I haven't got a delivery coming this week as I wanted to use up some things from the store cupboard and freezer, but over the last two months I've been ordering a fortnightly box from a well-known meal plan company. I select five meals from a wide menu and it then delivers all the ingredients and recipe card to my door. The meals are all for two people so I either freeze the second portion or have it for the lunch the next day.I've been able to use discount codes and vouchers, so the overall cost has been reduced, making it almost the equivalent of what I would usually spend on a week's shopping. I wouldn't be able to justify paying full price for the service but I do like the convenience of having it all packed and delivered - if only they could do the washing up after! While I do the meal selection today, the payment for the box won't actually be made until next Monday when it is delivered - which means today's total spend is £0.Total spend: £0I used up the last of the milk when Annie and I had breakfast this morning, not even enough left for one cup of tea - so once I've dropped her at nursery, I make a quick run into Tesco and pick up six pints of semi-skimmed for £1.50.It really is a quick run - I am in the shop for all of five minutes and most of that I spend in the queue for the self-service. While the kettle boils I put tonight's dinner in the slow cooker. It is just a simple chilli today, which Annie loves as she is a huge fan of mushrooms and kidney beans. She'll have a little bit for her supper when she comes home from nursery. During the week, Annie has the option of a second breakfast at nursery, and then she has a cooked lunch, tea, and two snacks during the day. As a solo mum working full-time, I was pleased to find a nursery that ""home-cooks"" all their meals on site so I know she is getting good quality food like she would at home.Even so, it's important to me that Annie and I always sit down together to eat supper in the evening.  Sometimes I'll cook my dinner while she sits on the kitchen side and ""helps me"", and then she'll have a little bit of it for supper.Total spend: £1.50April is a busy month for friends' birthdays, and there are two coming up this weekend so I use my lunch break to go to the shops and get their presents.It feels like a luxury to shop for ""non-essential"" items and even more so going without Annie who is at nursery which means I can have a proper browse around the aisles.I decide on some hanging plant pots for one friend, and Annie and I will add some flowers we have been growing. For the other friend, who is a chocoholic, I buy a new mug, some hot chocolate and mini marshmallows and a little box of Milk Tray. At the last minute I add a scented candle too, so the total for both gifts comes to £17.43I check my bank account at least once a week to make sure that all my direct debits have gone as planned - today I see that my membership fee for the British Association of Social Workers has been paid (£24.42) and my monthly child sponsorship through Compassion has been paid too (£33).Which brings my total spend for today to £74.85It's been a long week, so I invite a friend over to have a takeaway in the gardens. We choose a pop-up burger restaurant that we both love - and I decide to treat my friend as she's a teacher and going back to school on Monday after the Easter holiday. We order a deal for two, which comes to £25.00 and is totally delicious.Total spend: £25.00Annie and I love the weekend, and over lockdown we have got used to having a lie-in and looking at books in my bed, then having pancakes for breakfast and staying in our pyjamas for most of the morning.Not so today though - as the easing of Covid restrictions means that Annie's pre-school gymnastics class is starting up again this morning!I pay her monthly fees for April, which are reduced to take into account that there are fewer Saturdays this month. This comes to £27.20. After gymnastics we head into town to go to the library - another exciting activity after lockdown.Since Annie has used up a lot of energy in her class, and to celebrate the fact that we just can, I take her to a lovely cafe to have brunch (outside!) Annie does a great job of ordering ""sausage, and scrambled egg, and mushroom and beans"" and I have a fantastic cooked breakfast (£15.00)Before we walk home, I pop to Tesco and to Aldi to get some basics. I usually do a ""big shop"" once a month at Aldi and fill up the store cupboard, fridge and freezer and then try to limit the number of ""top up"" shops that I do the rest of the month and just get milk and fresh fruit/veg.However, Annie has some food intolerances that Aldi doesn't accommodate for, so I always have to do at least one ""mini shop"" at Tesco to get ""Annie-safe"" yoghurt, bread and other items.  I spent £3.69 at Tesco, on yoghurt and bananas, and another £3.39 at Aldi on cereal, orange juice and lactose free milk.The total spend for today comes to £49.28I have another no-spend today, having bought all the ""top up"" groceries yesterday. Annie and I spend Sundays with our support bubble, which consists of two of my closest friends and their children who are four and six. Annie loves to play with them and it has been so good for all three of them to have each other to play with since bubbles were introduced in June last year.We have a lovely day relaxing in their garden, and it feels like spring is finally here.Total spend: £0Weekly total: £187.08How does Sarah feel about her week?My total spend for the week is £187.08 - but when I take into account that £81.87 of this is monthly direct debits it doesn't feel that high… only £105.21 was money that I ""actually"" spent. It is still a fair bit higher than my previous average weekly spend, but that was to be expected given it was the first week out of lockdown.It's extremely rare for me to have a takeaway and then eat out twice in the same week but it was really nice to be able to treat Annie to brunch in a café. She told me she has a ""good plan"" that every time she has gymnastics, we should go to a restaurant afterwards. I think she's onto something.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9A52/production/_118260593_6.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56929552,entertainment
139,COP26: Countries must make bold compromises at summit - PM,"Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said.The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit.Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rally was the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part.The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax.This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action.He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally.""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax.""Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including:The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action.Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense.

140,COP26: Countries must make bold compromises at summit - PM,"Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said.The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit.Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rally was the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part.The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax.This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action.He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally.""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax.""Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including:The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action.Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense.

141,Climate change: National Trust joins international call for peat product ban,"The National Trust is calling on the government to ban peat being used in compost, as part of efforts to try and limit climate change.It is one of more than a dozen international organisations asking for a switch to sustainable alternatives. Peat bogs are a carbon sink - meaning they soak up carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming.The UK government has already said it intends to ban the sale of peat compost to the public in England by 2024.But in a joint statement on peat, the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland - as well as similar groups including from Ireland, Korea and Indonesia - urged the government to ""act now"" and ban the sale of peat products in horticulture entirely.They made the call to coincide with the COP26 climate summit negotiations.Peat is the surface layer of soil, made up primarily of partially decomposed plant material which has developed in waterlogged and low oxygen conditions. It is filled with nutrients ideal for plant growth and is often used in compost, as well as harvested and burned as fuel. Research shows peatland traps almost twice as much carbon as forests, despite covering just 3% of the earth's surface. But peat bogs that have been drained, dug up for fuel or used in compost have the opposite effect and contributes to carbon emissions.The National Trust said healthy peatlands also help to control flooding and encourage vegetation that can provide homes for wildlife.The organisation, which is one of the largest landowners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it was taking action to eliminate the use of peat in its gardens and supply chains.National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said the international organisations were ""all taking action"" to eliminate the use of peat, but added ""we can't end this practice alone"".She called on members to ""make a positive choice for climate and for nature"" and buy peat-free compost to use in their gardens, as well as check whether plants they buy are peat free.Ms McGrady said: ""It is through this sort of collective effort that we can unite in the fight against climate change.""We also need government to step up and play their part by bringing in legislation that bans the sale of products containing peat.""Leading garden centres in the UK have been found to be failing to stop the sale of peat in compost, despite pressure from campaigners and government.Last year countryside charity CPRE warned emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reductions  made through new and existing forests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/63D4/production/_121465552_hi071788726.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59195535,science
142,COP26: Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest,"About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.The protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.Greta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.Police arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. Officers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.However the force said the day passed ""largely without incident"". The ""Global Day of Action for Climate Justice"" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.In London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. The opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""It was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.Away from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"".  He tweeted: ""Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.""We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.""Police Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. A spokesperson said: ""We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.""After the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been ""generally good natured"", with people in ""high spirits"".He confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.He said: ""Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.""Despite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. Flags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.One enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for £3.There was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. Members of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.A helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.One group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.The event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.They were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.One of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.It was summed by a banner which read: ""Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists"".The sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.But the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  World leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.But there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.Countries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. ""This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.""Representatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. Some have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. Marchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.Edinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of ""Pedal on COP26"" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.The cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.Police said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of ""congestion issues"". ""Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,"" a Police Scotland tweet said. Bleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. High winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. Saturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BCBC/production/_121461384_071792390-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59185007,science
143,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". ""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". ""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

144,"Boy, 7, takes school reusable bottle campaign to Holyrood","A seven-year-old boy who is campaigning to replace single-use water bottles in school lunchboxes has been invited to speak to MSPs. Callum Isted wants all primary children in Scotland to have a reusable bottle and access to taps where they can refill them at school. He completed the John Muir Way in stages to raise £1,400 to buy steel bottles for all pupils at his school. They were previously given single use bottles with a packed lunch on Fridays. On Mondays to Thursdays the children at Dedridge Primary School in Livingston, West Lothian, had water or milk in washable cups. But on Fridays, when they have a half day, children were sent home with a packed lunch and a bottle of water. ""What used to happen is all the plastic bottles got chucked in the bin and they go out to sea,"" Callum said. ""And that is 180 bottles per day. Now we're just to zero a day.""Earlier this year Callum walked the 134-mile John Muir Way, from Helensburgh to Dunbar, to raise enough money to buy Klean Kanteen steel bottles for the 185 pupils in his school. He was one of the winners of Education Scotland's Learning for Sustainability Youth Awards last month. After the online award ceremony Callum and his parents were given tickets to the COP26 Green Zone at Glasgow Science Centre, where public events are being held during the United Nations climate change conference.And earlier this week his petition to the Scottish Parliament, which received 146 signatures, was considered by MSPs.He was congratulated by Jackson Carlaw at the Scottish Parliament's petition committee for being the county's youngest known petitioner. Callum would be invited to Holyrood's Citizen Participation committee to give evidence in support of his petition to allow the committee ""to explore the issues raised in the petition in some detail"", Mr Carlow said. Sue Webber MSP told the committee she was happy to support him. She said: ""He's certainly a determined and passionate young man already.""His mother, Sarah Isted, told BBC Scotland she was very proud of Callum. She said he weighed a bottle he'd brought home from school and calculated the total weight of bottles his school threw out each year was about that of a giant panda at Edinburgh Zoo. ""That figure really upset him and really galvanised him into action,"" Mrs Isted said. At home he questions where food and clothes come from and questions the family's use of plastics. ""He really holds us to account. It can only be a positive thing because things do need to change.""There are more 2,005 mainstream state primary schools in Scotland, and 394,000 pupils. In some schools children are given water in single use plastic bottles with lunch. The responsibility for providing school meals lies with the local authority, not the Scottish government. While many schools encourage children to bring a reusable water bottle each day, some have restricted access to taps for refilling bottles. When schools reopened in August 2020 after the coronavirus lockdown, staff in some areas were advised not to allow children to refill their bottles because of the risk of transferring saliva if bottles touched the tap. In a committee briefing for Callum's petition, government researchers said tap water caused 180 times fewer greenhouse emission that than a standard single use plastic bottle of water. A ""typical"" plastic reusable container needed to be used 15 times to have a lower carbon impact than a single use one, and could be expected to have positive environmental impact and cost less than bottled water, it stated. The Scottish government aims to have moved away from a ""throw-away"" economy to one where resources are reused wisely by 2045. A deposit return scheme has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Matheson MSP told the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee in September that the government was taking measures to support schools reduce waste.

145,Climate change: Carbon emissions show rapid rebound after Covid dip,"Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists.The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down.But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year.It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C.This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels.Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: ""What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021.""That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.""This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming.The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry. It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.Prof Corinne Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.""The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown.So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable.Read more about the COP26 summit here.""Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,"" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter.Prof Le Quéré concurred: ""This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.""Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. ""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained. ""But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. ""If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.""At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing.Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/180A9/production/_121337489_gettyimages-96390221.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59148520,science
146,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon as the planet can absorb.If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon than their share.One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DE9/production/_121435711_gettyimages-815252586.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59157836,science
147,COP26: Countries must make bold compromises at summit - PM,"Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said.The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit.Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rally was the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part.The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax.This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action.He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally.""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax.""Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including:The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action.Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. But unless more is done, the planet is already on course to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century.Several countries, as well as UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, want accelerated action on emissions cuts this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive.Experts and climate change campaigners have welcomed the commitments, but argued they need to be delivered on  - warning a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"".Similarly, activists have argued the deal on coal ""falls well short of the ambition needed"", as the ""small print gives countries enormous leeway"" to choose when to phase out the fossil fuel. Mr Johnson said: ""There is one week left for COP26 to deliver for the world, and we must all pull together and drive for the line.""He said nations had brought ""ambition and action to help limit rising temperatures"", and referred to the pledges that have been made during COP26 - including on deforestation and methane emissions.""But we cannot underestimate the task at hand to keep 1.5C alive,"" he added.""Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed.""Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has warned the world is a ""long way off"" where it needs to be to take the ""major steps"" to ensure global warming does not exceed 1.5C.The Labour MP urged the prime minister to personally head up the negotiations in the final days of COP26, rather than engaging in ""empty exhortation and commentary"".He said: ""We have a right to expect him to engage directly in these final days, personally driving these negotiations forward, pushing all the major emitters to do more, delivering the finance required for developing and vulnerable countries and ensuring we have a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive.""He needs to step up with focus, clarity and urgency in the face of the massive task the world faces in the coming days.""COP26 president Alok Sharma said the billions of dollars to restore the natural world that had been promised during the first week of the summit was humanity's ""first line of defence"" against the crisis.He told a news conference in Glasgow on Saturday that if the world reaches global warming of 1.5C above industrial levels, 70% of coral reefs would be lost.  If it gets to 2C, they would all die, he said.Mr Sharma said the UK will provide £500m to protect more than five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create thousands of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America.The UK is also launching a £65m Just Rural Transition support programme to help communities move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production, he added.Activists speaking at Saturday's climate change march in Glasgow included Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate, actor Idris Elba and representatives of indigenous people.Ms Nakate told the crowd: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/92FA/production/_121462673_af919aa4-3ac7-482c-a622-55b1c4cba149.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59191376,science
148,Climate change: National Trust joins international call for peat product ban,"The National Trust is calling on the government to ban peat being used in compost, as part of efforts to try and limit climate change.It is one of more than a dozen international organisations asking for a switch to sustainable alternatives. Peat bogs are a carbon sink - meaning they soak up carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming.The UK government has already said it intends to ban the sale of peat compost to the public in England by 2024.But in a joint statement on peat, the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland - as well as similar groups including from Ireland, Korea and Indonesia - urged the government to ""act now"" and ban the sale of peat products in horticulture entirely.They made the call to coincide with the COP26 climate summit negotiations.Peat is the surface layer of soil, made up primarily of partially decomposed plant material which has developed in waterlogged and low oxygen conditions. It is filled with nutrients ideal for plant growth and is often used in compost, as well as harvested and burned as fuel. Research shows peatland traps almost twice as much carbon as forests, despite covering just 3% of the earth's surface. But peat bogs that have been drained, dug up for fuel or used in compost have the opposite effect and contributes to carbon emissions.The National Trust said healthy peatlands also help to control flooding and encourage vegetation that can provide homes for wildlife.The organisation, which is one of the largest landowners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it was taking action to eliminate the use of peat in its gardens and supply chains.National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said the international organisations were ""all taking action"" to eliminate the use of peat, but added ""we can't end this practice alone"".She called on members to ""make a positive choice for climate and for nature"" and buy peat-free compost to use in their gardens, as well as check whether plants they buy are peat free.Ms McGrady said: ""It is through this sort of collective effort that we can unite in the fight against climate change.""We also need government to step up and play their part by bringing in legislation that bans the sale of products containing peat.""Leading garden centres in the UK have been found to be failing to stop the sale of peat in compost, despite pressure from campaigners and government.Last year countryside charity CPRE warned emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reductions  made through new and existing forests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/63D4/production/_121465552_hi071788726.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59195535,science
149,COP26: Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest,"About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.The protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.Greta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.Police arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. Officers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.However the force said the day passed ""largely without incident"". The ""Global Day of Action for Climate Justice"" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.In London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. The opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""It was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.Away from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"".  He tweeted: ""Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.""We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.""Police Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. A spokesperson said: ""We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.""After the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been ""generally good natured"", with people in ""high spirits"".He confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.He said: ""Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.""Despite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. Flags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.One enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for £3.There was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. Members of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.A helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.One group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.The event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.They were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.One of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.It was summed by a banner which read: ""Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists"".The sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.But the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  World leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.But there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.Countries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. ""This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.""Representatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. Some have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. Marchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.Edinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of ""Pedal on COP26"" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.The cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.Police said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of ""congestion issues"". ""Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,"" a Police Scotland tweet said. Bleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. High winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. Saturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BCBC/production/_121461384_071792390-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59185007,science
150,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". ""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". ""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

151,"Boy, 7, takes school reusable bottle campaign to Holyrood","A seven-year-old boy who is campaigning to replace single-use water bottles in school lunchboxes has been invited to speak to MSPs. Callum Isted wants all primary children in Scotland to have a reusable bottle and access to taps where they can refill them at school. He completed the John Muir Way in stages to raise £1,400 to buy steel bottles for all pupils at his school. They were previously given single use bottles with a packed lunch on Fridays. On Mondays to Thursdays the children at Dedridge Primary School in Livingston, West Lothian, had water or milk in washable cups. But on Fridays, when they have a half day, children were sent home with a packed lunch and a bottle of water. ""What used to happen is all the plastic bottles got chucked in the bin and they go out to sea,"" Callum said. ""And that is 180 bottles per day. Now we're just to zero a day.""Earlier this year Callum walked the 134-mile John Muir Way, from Helensburgh to Dunbar, to raise enough money to buy Klean Kanteen steel bottles for the 185 pupils in his school. He was one of the winners of Education Scotland's Learning for Sustainability Youth Awards last month. After the online award ceremony Callum and his parents were given tickets to the COP26 Green Zone at Glasgow Science Centre, where public events are being held during the United Nations climate change conference.And earlier this week his petition to the Scottish Parliament, which received 146 signatures, was considered by MSPs.He was congratulated by Jackson Carlaw at the Scottish Parliament's petition committee for being the county's youngest known petitioner. Callum would be invited to Holyrood's Citizen Participation committee to give evidence in support of his petition to allow the committee ""to explore the issues raised in the petition in some detail"", Mr Carlow said. Sue Webber MSP told the committee she was happy to support him. She said: ""He's certainly a determined and passionate young man already.""His mother, Sarah Isted, told BBC Scotland she was very proud of Callum. She said he weighed a bottle he'd brought home from school and calculated the total weight of bottles his school threw out each year was about that of a giant panda at Edinburgh Zoo. ""That figure really upset him and really galvanised him into action,"" Mrs Isted said. At home he questions where food and clothes come from and questions the family's use of plastics. ""He really holds us to account. It can only be a positive thing because things do need to change.""There are more 2,005 mainstream state primary schools in Scotland, and 394,000 pupils. In some schools children are given water in single use plastic bottles with lunch. The responsibility for providing school meals lies with the local authority, not the Scottish government. While many schools encourage children to bring a reusable water bottle each day, some have restricted access to taps for refilling bottles. When schools reopened in August 2020 after the coronavirus lockdown, staff in some areas were advised not to allow children to refill their bottles because of the risk of transferring saliva if bottles touched the tap. In a committee briefing for Callum's petition, government researchers said tap water caused 180 times fewer greenhouse emission that than a standard single use plastic bottle of water. A ""typical"" plastic reusable container needed to be used 15 times to have a lower carbon impact than a single use one, and could be expected to have positive environmental impact and cost less than bottled water, it stated. The Scottish government aims to have moved away from a ""throw-away"" economy to one where resources are reused wisely by 2045. A deposit return scheme has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Matheson MSP told the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee in September that the government was taking measures to support schools reduce waste.

152,Climate change: Carbon emissions show rapid rebound after Covid dip,"Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists.The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down.But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year.It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C.This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels.Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: ""What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021.""That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.""This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming.The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry. It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.Prof Corinne Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.""The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown.So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable.Read more about the COP26 summit here.""Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,"" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter.Prof Le Quéré concurred: ""This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.""Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. ""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained. ""But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. ""If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.""At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing.Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/180A9/production/_121337489_gettyimages-96390221.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59148520,science
153,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon as the planet can absorb.If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon than their share.One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DE9/production/_121435711_gettyimages-815252586.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59157836,science
154,Climate change: National Trust joins international call for peat product ban,"The National Trust is calling on the government to ban peat being used in compost, as part of efforts to try and limit climate change.It is one of more than a dozen international organisations asking for a switch to sustainable alternatives. Peat bogs are a carbon sink - meaning they soak up carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming.The UK government has already said it intends to ban the sale of peat compost to the public in England by 2024.But in a joint statement on peat, the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland - as well as similar groups including from Ireland, Korea and Indonesia - urged the government to ""act now"" and ban the sale of peat products in horticulture entirely.They made the call to coincide with the COP26 climate summit negotiations.Peat is the surface layer of soil, made up primarily of partially decomposed plant material which has developed in waterlogged and low oxygen conditions. It is filled with nutrients ideal for plant growth and is often used in compost, as well as harvested and burned as fuel. Research shows peatland traps almost twice as much carbon as forests, despite covering just 3% of the earth's surface. But peat bogs that have been drained, dug up for fuel or used in compost have the opposite effect and contributes to carbon emissions.The National Trust said healthy peatlands also help to control flooding and encourage vegetation that can provide homes for wildlife.The organisation, which is one of the largest landowners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said it was taking action to eliminate the use of peat in its gardens and supply chains.National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said the international organisations were ""all taking action"" to eliminate the use of peat, but added ""we can't end this practice alone"".She called on members to ""make a positive choice for climate and for nature"" and buy peat-free compost to use in their gardens, as well as check whether plants they buy are peat free.Ms McGrady said: ""It is through this sort of collective effort that we can unite in the fight against climate change.""We also need government to step up and play their part by bringing in legislation that bans the sale of products containing peat.""Leading garden centres in the UK have been found to be failing to stop the sale of peat in compost, despite pressure from campaigners and government.Last year countryside charity CPRE warned emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reductions  made through new and existing forests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/63D4/production/_121465552_hi071788726.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59195535,science
155,COP26: Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest,"About 100,000 people marched in Glasgow to demand more action on the climate crisis, organisers have said.The protest was the biggest so far during the COP26 summit and took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.Greta Thunberg joined the march but did not speak, leaving activists such as Vanessa Nakate to address a rally.Police arrested 21 scientists who chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge over the River Clyde. Officers also contained a group of socialist activists after pyrotechnics were set off during the march - one person was then arrested.However the force said the day passed ""largely without incident"". The ""Global Day of Action for Climate Justice"" march started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada.In London, protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square while another large demonstration happened in Cardiff. The opening speeches at the protest rally at Glasgow Green came from representatives of indigenous people around the globe.Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate later told protesters: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""It was understood that Greta Thunberg decided to give space to other speakers as she had already addressed youth activists in a march and rally on Friday.Away from the march, 21 protesters from Scientist Rebellion were arrested after chaining themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre.Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"".  He tweeted: ""Over 15,000 scientists declared that we're in a climate emergency, but most aren't acting as if it's an emergency.""We're taking this action to encourage others, scientists and all people, to rise up in rebellion against the system that is killing everything.""Police Scotland closed the bridge to pedestrians and vehicles during the protest. A spokesperson said: ""We have facilitated a peaceful protest, but to balance right to protest with public safety and rights of the wider community, our protest removal team is safely removing protesters.""After the event at Glasgow Green dispersed, Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said the atmosphere had been ""generally good natured"", with people in ""high spirits"".He confirmed one person had been arrested after a socialist group was contained and a further 21 were arrested following the King George V Bridge incident.He said: ""Glasgow has today hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. I am pleased to say today has passed largely without incident. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers.""Despite the grim weather there was a carnival atmosphere at the start of the march in Kelvingrove Park, with one group playing steel drums to entertain the crowd. Flags and banners were blowing in the wind and most activists were sporting multiple layers in a bid to combat the cold and rain.One enterprising local vendor who was selling whistles at the youth march on Friday was today offering ponchos for £3.There was a heavy police presence and officers paid particular attention to a group of socialist activists dressed in black and wearing red face masks. Members of the group were still being closely monitored more than five hours later when they were among the last to arrive at Glasgow Green.A helicopter hovered overhead as the demonstration snaked through the west end and city centre.One group set off a red flare in Finnieston but the march was good natured throughout and I saw no signs of any trouble.The event was the largest protest in Glasgow since the Stop the Iraq War march in 2003 and groups representing a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from indigenous people to refugees, made for a colourful spectacle.They were entertained along the way by acts including a bagpiper and a man singing karaoke dressed as Darth Vadar.One of the highlights was a spontaneous outbreak of applause which greeted the marchers as they arrived in George Square.It was summed by a banner which read: ""Glasgow Welcomes Climate Activists"".The sun had come out by the time the mass protest arrived at Glasgow Green and some revellers even enjoyed a dance party outside the High Court in Glasgow.But the huge crowd was later left disappointed when it emerged celebrated climate activist Greta Thunberg would not be addressing the rally.  World leaders and representatives who came to Glasgow for the climate change summit have so far made promises to curb deforestation, phase out coal, end funding for fossil fuels abroad and cut methane emissions.But there is still a significant gap between the measures countries have committed to and what is needed to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, beyond which the worst floods, droughts, storms and rising seas of climate change will be felt.Countries are under pressure to agree on actions for the next decade, finance loans for developing countries to cope with the crisis and finalise the last parts of how the global Paris Agreement on climate change will work.Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition, said: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. ""This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people side-lined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place. Today those people are having their voices heard.""Representatives of indigenous communities from North and South America joined the march in Glasgow. Some have no formal representation at COP26, despite living at the frontline of environmental destruction caused by mining or deforestation, because they are not recognised by their governments. Marchers came from across the UK to take part in the Glasgow march, including surfers from Cornwall.Edinburgh COP Coalition put on 13 coaches to travel to the event while a series of ""Pedal on COP26"" bike rides were organised from more than 20 areas of Scotland, the longest rides being from Inverness, Aberdeen and Dumfries setting off on Friday.The cyclists brought up the rear of the march, which took near two hours to leave Kelvingrove Park, making the line of protesters almost two miles (3.2km) long.Police said they blocked a section of the crowd between Holland Street and St Vincent Street because of ""congestion issues"". ""Following an escalation in their conduct a small number of people from the group who deliberately stopped on the parade route at the junction of Holland Street and St Vincent Street were contained by police on the grounds of public safety,"" a Police Scotland tweet said. Bleak weather with heavy showers and gusts of wind greeted early arrivals to the march, but the weather improved over the afternoon. High winds, however, continued to cause a problem, hampering efforts to set up the main stage at Glasgow Green. and speakers instead used the stage company's lorry as a platform. Saturday's march came after many young activists - including striking school pupils - took part in a mass demonstration in the city on Friday.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BCBC/production/_121461384_071792390-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59185007,science
156,COP26: Duke of Edinburgh-style climate award to launch,"Pupils will be recognised for their efforts to protect the environment in a new Duke of Edinburgh-style award. It is one of a series of measures aimed at putting climate change at the heart of education. The plans are being set out by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Staff will also be supported to teach children about nature and their impact on the world through a ""model science curriculum"", to be in place by 2023.Climate change is already taught in science and geography lessons in England as part of the curriculum.Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the model science curriculum would ""support and enrich"" the teaching of climate change for primary school pupils.The education secretary - who is also the climate change minister for his department - said the ""education and empowerment of youth"" was important and education ministers from other countries are coming together at COP26 on Friday to learn from each other. The Climate Leaders award will help children to develop their skills and knowledge in biodiversity and sustainability, with their work recognised at an annual national awards ceremony. Pupils will be able to progress through different levels of the award - bronze, silver and gold - in a similar way to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which includes volunteering and extracurricular activities. The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot ""energy pods"" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a school's heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful. Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have ""net zero in operation"".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022. The education secretary will host a panel session on the sixth day of the COP26 conference, which is focused on youth and public empowerment, with education ministers from around the world. Mr Zahawi said ""education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change"". ""Empowering teachers in every school to deliver world-leading climate change education will not only raise awareness and understanding of the problem, but also equips young people with the skills and knowledge to build a sustainable future,"" he added.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders' union NAHT, said there was a ""huge amount of good work already taking place in schools to reduce their carbon footprint"" - but ""a coherent national strategy is essential if we are to see real impact"". ""The government must be truly ambitious, not just looking to new buildings, but also at how the existing school estate can be made as environmentally-friendly as possible,"" he said. He added that any work on a new model curriculum must be developed ""in close consultation with the profession"". Meanwhile thousands of young people are taking part in a climate protest in Glasgow organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg - who is taking part in the demonstration.One of those taking part is Finlay Pringle, 14, from Ullapool in the Highlands. He said young people ""shouldn't think twice"" about protesting in support of the things they care about.The education secretary urged pupils not to miss lessons, telling Times Radio he hoped young people would protest ""on a Saturday and a Sunday, not in school time"". No 10 added that young people missing school to attend climate demonstrations was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools were already working ""very hard on tackling climate change"" but ""children and young people rightly want to see far more concerted action from policy-makers"".

157,"Boy, 7, takes school reusable bottle campaign to Holyrood","A seven-year-old boy who is campaigning to replace single-use water bottles in school lunchboxes has been invited to speak to MSPs. Callum Isted wants all primary children in Scotland to have a reusable bottle and access to taps where they can refill them at school. He completed the John Muir Way in stages to raise £1,400 to buy steel bottles for all pupils at his school. They were previously given single use bottles with a packed lunch on Fridays. On Mondays to Thursdays the children at Dedridge Primary School in Livingston, West Lothian, had water or milk in washable cups. But on Fridays, when they have a half day, children were sent home with a packed lunch and a bottle of water. ""What used to happen is all the plastic bottles got chucked in the bin and they go out to sea,"" Callum said. ""And that is 180 bottles per day. Now we're just to zero a day.""Earlier this year Callum walked the 134-mile John Muir Way, from Helensburgh to Dunbar, to raise enough money to buy Klean Kanteen steel bottles for the 185 pupils in his school. He was one of the winners of Education Scotland's Learning for Sustainability Youth Awards last month. After the online award ceremony Callum and his parents were given tickets to the COP26 Green Zone at Glasgow Science Centre, where public events are being held during the United Nations climate change conference.And earlier this week his petition to the Scottish Parliament, which received 146 signatures, was considered by MSPs.He was congratulated by Jackson Carlaw at the Scottish Parliament's petition committee for being the county's youngest known petitioner. Callum would be invited to Holyrood's Citizen Participation committee to give evidence in support of his petition to allow the committee ""to explore the issues raised in the petition in some detail"", Mr Carlow said. Sue Webber MSP told the committee she was happy to support him. She said: ""He's certainly a determined and passionate young man already.""His mother, Sarah Isted, told BBC Scotland she was very proud of Callum. She said he weighed a bottle he'd brought home from school and calculated the total weight of bottles his school threw out each year was about that of a giant panda at Edinburgh Zoo. ""That figure really upset him and really galvanised him into action,"" Mrs Isted said. At home he questions where food and clothes come from and questions the family's use of plastics. ""He really holds us to account. It can only be a positive thing because things do need to change.""There are more 2,005 mainstream state primary schools in Scotland, and 394,000 pupils. In some schools children are given water in single use plastic bottles with lunch. The responsibility for providing school meals lies with the local authority, not the Scottish government. While many schools encourage children to bring a reusable water bottle each day, some have restricted access to taps for refilling bottles. When schools reopened in August 2020 after the coronavirus lockdown, staff in some areas were advised not to allow children to refill their bottles because of the risk of transferring saliva if bottles touched the tap. In a committee briefing for Callum's petition, government researchers said tap water caused 180 times fewer greenhouse emission that than a standard single use plastic bottle of water. A ""typical"" plastic reusable container needed to be used 15 times to have a lower carbon impact than a single use one, and could be expected to have positive environmental impact and cost less than bottled water, it stated. The Scottish government aims to have moved away from a ""throw-away"" economy to one where resources are reused wisely by 2045. A deposit return scheme has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Matheson MSP told the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee in September that the government was taking measures to support schools reduce waste.

158,Climate change: Carbon emissions show rapid rebound after Covid dip,"Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists.The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down.But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year.It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C.This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels.Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: ""What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021.""That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.""This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming.The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry. It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.Prof Corinne Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.""The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown.So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable.Read more about the COP26 summit here.""Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,"" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter.Prof Le Quéré concurred: ""This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.""Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. ""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained. ""But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. ""If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.""At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing.Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/180A9/production/_121337489_gettyimages-96390221.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59148520,science
159,COP26: Emissions of rich put climate goals at risk - study,"The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says.But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam.The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating.""Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon as the planet can absorb.If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year.The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. A recent study that tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon than their share.One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci.Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week.""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci.For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says.  He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking.Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"".""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DE9/production/_121435711_gettyimages-815252586.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59157836,science
160,COP26: Time to sober up,"So how much progress has really been made in the opening days of COP26 and what are the main challenges that lie ahead?To paraphrase COP26 president Alok Sharma, this is the moment when the rubber is finally meeting the road. After a first week dominated by a blizzard of announcements of new initiatives in the real world, the conference is now moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations.The main focus will still be on devising a plan to bend the temperature curve below 1.5C.There has been quite a bit of speculation that the first week announcements made by countries and the new pledges on methane and coal have already moved the needle on the rise in global temperatures that's likely this century. According to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. At the start of the COP the latest analysis from the UN suggested a rise of 2.7C. So just how real is this large predicted drop?""None of the countries that has a net zero target has implemented sufficient short term policies to put itself on a trajectory towards net zero,"" said Dr Niklas Höhne, from the New Climate Institute, who monitor and assess national carbon cutting plans.""Right now it's more a vision, or imagination. And it's not matched by action.""As one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. Next week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. These will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. Some progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions.As deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous.""It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,"" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. ""I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work.""There will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. There is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. Despite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. The cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return.""Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,"" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. The failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. While the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely.For the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. UK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a ""cover decision"", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. The key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. The most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time.There is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed.""You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,"" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank.""I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement.""""It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.""Matt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

161,Black black oil: The challenge of giving up North Sea extraction,"The North Sea still contains large quantities of oil and gas but, in the midst of a climate emergency, how much longer can it continue to be extracted?To keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century.Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency set out a road map to this which said there should be no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects - in other words no new oil and gas fields.This causes a problem for oil and gas producers around the world but also for how countries function.""I guess we have an addiction to oil and gas in our society,"" Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of Oil and Gas UK, tells the BBC documentary Black Black Oil.""Just to stop it for the sake of stopping it is not going to stop the demand that is associated with it,"" she says.Climate activists say the failure to act quickly enough to move away from fossil fuels is allowing the oil firms to carry on, making the climate emergency more difficult to tackle.Young Scottish activist Holly Gillibrand says: ""I think people will look back at this era of oil and think about how ridiculous it was.""We know the climate and ecological crisis is happening, we know how bad it could get. How could you worry about such a massive issue and still worry more about profit?""In the documentary, James Marriot, the author of Crude Britannia, explains how speculative North Sea exploration in the late 1960s became a gold rush after BP found oil in the massive Forties field, 100 miles off to the north east of Aberdeen.The first North Sea oil came ashore in June 1975 and is thought to have peaked in 1999, with about 45 billion barrels extracted so far.Although the oil and gas is now tougher to extract, the reserves are substantial, with another 20 to 30 years of production thought to be possible.The Cambo oil field, west of Shetland, which contains more than 800 million barrels of oil, has proved particularly controversial.If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at the Cambo field could start as early as 2022 and last 25 years.Holly Gillibrand, who was inspired by the school strikes of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, tells the documentary: ""If the politicians are saying that they're tackling the climate ecological crisis and taking it seriously and then extracting more North Sea oil, then that's just making this problem deeper. ""You can't fill in a hole unless you stop digging, and we really need to stop digging.""Jake Molloy, regional organiser of the RMT Union, who has worked in the industry for decades, says: ""Even if we shut the North Sea down tomorrow, we are still going to be reliant on oil and gas and we are going to be importing it for years to come because 80% of domestic heating is currently natural gas. ""To my mind, rather than shutting the North Sea down we should exploit it as part of the transition.""Emeka Emembolu, senior vice-president of BP North Sea, describes that transition away from decades of reliance on hydrocarbons for transport, heating and manufacturing as ""almost like replacing all the veins in the human body"".But he says his company is trying to make the shift.BP was a major player from the beginning of North Sea exploration and until quite recently operated 22 fields. It is now down to just six.Mr Emembolu says: ""We will maintain some level of oil and gas production over time but we are hugely ramping up our investments in non-oil and gas forms of energy as well.""He says BP is getting involved in the ScotWind leasing process with an aim to build offshore wind farms but the process from acquiring the lease to installing the turbines can be as long as 10 years.""We will do everything we can to compress that period and make it faster but what we're talking about is changing the infrastructure of the world,"" he says. ""That takes time.""Shell is another major player in the North Sea which has taken a step back. It owns 30% of the controversial Cambo development it but it is not the operator.The company behind the Cambo proposal is Siccar Point Energy, backed by private equity firm investors.The most active driller in the North Sea is now a company called Harbour Energy.Its chief executive Phil Kirk says it bought a big chunk of Shell in what was a ""transformative deal"".Oil workers' union representative Jake Molloy suggests the investment houses behind such deals may soon themselves feel the pressure of being exposed and attacked for continuing to invest in oil and gas and ""pull the plug"".""Oil and gas workers now are very nervous about what the future holds for them,"" he says.Steve Waygood, chief responsible investor at Aviva Investors, agrees that ethical investment plays a role in the future of oil and gas although until now markets have been quite ""amoral"" and only concerned with return on equity.He says oil has seen a huge decline in its returns over the past decade whereas solar and wind have improved dramatically.Mr Waygood says the London Stock Exchange is one of the worst exchanges in the world in terms of exposure to large oil companies listed on it.""People's pensions, savings and investments are actually invested in financing a future that no-one wants to see but no-one really realises,"" he says.""We own companies that are undermining what we wish to bequeath to our children.""Climate lawyer Tessa Khan says that is why we have to move to solar and wind now.She says: ""To continue to lock in our dependency on oil and gas because we think that in 30 years time we might still need it is a huge mistake and it is missing an opportunity to be at the forefront of this energy revolution.""Black Black Oil is on the BBC Scotland channel on Wednesday 3 November at 22:00.

162,UK's 'longest-lasting' snow patch melts away,"What is historically the UK's longest lasting patch of snow has disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"".Dubbed the Sphinx, the patch on remote Braeriach in the Cairngorms has melted away more frequently in the last 18 years.Snow patch expert Iain Cameron said climate change was a likely factor.According to records, the Sphinx previously melted fully in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018.Before 1933, it is thought to have last melted completely in the 1700s.The Sphinx had shrunk to the size of an A4 piece of paper in recent weeks before finally disappearing in mild weather.Stirling-based Mr Cameron has been studying snow patches in Scotland for 25 years and is author of the book The Vanishing Ice, which he describes as a ""lament"" to snow and ice that lingers high in Scotland's hills.He worked alongside the late Dr Adam Watson, a biologist dubbed Mr Cairngorms because of his many years studying the mountains.Some of Dr Watson's research on the Sphinx drew on information handed down by generations of people who worked and visited the Cairngorms, which suggests the patch may have only melted a few times in the last 300 years.From the 1840s the Scottish Mountaineering Club began noting the fortunes of the patch, and more recently scientists and ecologists have gathered information. Mr Cameron told BBC Scotland that historically the Sphinx was the UK's ""most durable"" snow patch.But he said: ""That is being challenged because it is disappearing more often.""Mr Cameron said warmer weather due to climate change ""seemed to be the logical"" explanation for the increased rate of melting.He added that the conditions were affecting snowy areas high on other Scottish mountains including in the Ben Nevis range in Lochaber.Aonach Beag, near Ben Nevis, also has a patch of snow that has often survived from one winter to another.But Mr Cameron said: ""What we are seeing from research are smaller and fewer patches of snow.""Less snow is falling now in winter than in the 1980s and even the 1990s.""Separately from Mr Cameron's research, a report commissioned by Cairngorms National Park Authority and published last year said declining snow cover, and fewer days when it snowed had been observed on Cairngorm mountain since the winter of 1983-84.Researchers also noted a trend for increasingly warmer weather since the 1960s, and suggested that by the 2080s there would be some years with very little or no snow at all on Cairngorm.Lauren McCallum, of international climate change campaign group Protect Our Winters, said the Cairngorms - and wider world - needed to be protected from further rises in temperature.She said: ""We have to maintain a healthy temperature for our ecosystems and communities to survive.""The Sphinx lies in Garbh Choire Mor, a hollow known as a corrie formed by ice or a glacier during the last ice age, on 1,296m (4,252ft) Braeriach - Britain's third highest mountain.Garbh Choire Mor is described as Scotland's snowiest corrie because of the amount of snow it can hold even through summer months.The Sphinx is the name of a climbing route near the snow patch.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

163,COP26: What's the climate impact of private jets?,"There has been criticism of the number of world leaders and other delegates who have travelled to the COP26 summit in private jets.How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice?Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there.And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades.We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles, known as ""The Beast"", with him in Glasgow. He also had one in Rome on Sunday.FlightRadar24, which tracks flights, has looked at the number of non-commercial flights into Glasgow, Prestwick and Edinburgh airports since 27 October, excluding cargo, regular or local journeys.It has found that there were about 182 such flights, which is about double the total for the previous six days. That excludes some national chartered flights, such as President Biden's plane, Air Force One.Aviation analytics company Cirium told the BBC there was a total of 76 flights involving private jets, or VIP flights, arriving in and around Glasgow in the four days leading up to 1 November.Private jets have also been flying from Glasgow Airport, in Paisley, where they have dropped off passengers, to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, in Ayrshire, where they have been parking - a distance of about 41km.Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport.But this varies considerably depending on size, occupancy levels and efficiency. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights. There are many different models of private jet, but the Cessna Citation XLS - consistently one of the most popular - burns 189 gallons (857 litres) of aviation fuel an hour on average.If we were to consider the journey from Rome to Glasgow on a private jet - a journey that some of the G20 leaders made to get to COP 26 - that would take around two hours and 45 minutes, requiring 2,356 litres of jet fuel. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says 2.52kg of carbon dioxide is emitted for every litre of aviation turbine fuel burned. Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.However, BEIS recommends that to ""capture the maximum climate impact"" of flights, CO2 emissions figures should be multiplied by 1.9 to reflect the effect of non-CO2 emissions released by planes at high altitude, which, scientists say, increase the warming effect. Therefore, the total emissions for this flight would be 11.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and with a capacity of nine, each passenger would be responsible for 1.2 tonnes on their journey.If, however, our world leaders had decided to take a commercial flight from Rome to Glasgow their emissions would have been a quarter of a tonne each. Even though a commercial flight uses more fuel per hour, it is able to fly far more passengers than a private jet and therefore produces fewer emissions per person. ""A huge amount of fuel is used during takeoff and landing of a plane, no matter how many people you have on board. So an already polluting mode of transport (commercial aviation) becomes even worse (with private jets),"" said Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert in decarbonising transport at University of Oxford.In April, US President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit for world leaders, at which some commitments were made.But several have been talking at this summit about the value of meeting in person.The president of Sierra Leone said: ""I have travelled extensively because I have to be there - we're talking about challenges and the environment in Sierra Leone. If I don't come here, how will they know?""UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said face-to-face talks were needed for ""crunch negotiations"" such as this.Another question being asked on social media is why the meeting of the G20 that happened right before COP26 had to be in Rome.The G20 is a group of big economies plus the European Union. It has a summit once a year, hosted by whichever country is holding the rotating presidency of the group.If COP26 had been in November 2020, as originally planned, it would have been followed by the G20 summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Update 3 November: The piece has been amended to change US gallons to UK gallons in the example of the Cessna plane.Read more about the COP26 summit here.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

164,James Webb: Hubble telescope successor faces 'two weeks of terror',"Engineers like to describe the process of landing a rover on Mars as the ""seven minutes of terror"". That's how long it takes for a robot to come to a standing-stop at the surface of the Red Planet after entering the atmosphere faster than a rifle bullet; and so much has to go right in-between to avoid smashing into the ground.But when it comes to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it's more like ""two weeks of terror"".The successor observatory to the mighty Hubble telescope has been built to see the very first stars to shine in the Universe. These very faint, very distant targets require a huge telescope design, one that is so big it has to be folded to fit inside its launch rocket, and then, once in orbit, unfolded again to begin taking pictures of the cosmos.This unfurling has been called an origami exercise in reverse, where the delicate figure is the size of a tennis court.It all takes place over a period of about 14 days, immediately after the launch in mid-December. It will involve an astonishing symphony of hinges, motors, gears, springs, pulleys and cables - all of which must work on command and to perfection.There are no fewer than 344 ""single point failures"" - critical moments in the timeline where, if the action doesn't occur on cue, the six-tonne telescope cannot achieve the desired configuration, fatally undermining its $10bn mission.The expansion of the five super-thin membranes that will shield Webb's vision from interfering sunlight look particularly tricky. Heart-stopping, to be honest. But there is a quiet confidence in the engineering teams, led by the US space agency (Nasa) and aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman (NG). And that's because they've tested and rehearsed everything, over and over and over again.""The sunshield is like a skydiver's parachute; it needs to be folded perfectly so that it unfolds and deploys perfectly without snags, without any tangles,"" said Northrop Grumman systems engineer Krystal Puga.""To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully.""Webb's drama begins almost as soon as the telescope comes off the top of its European Ariane rocket.First, the solar array must come out. No power, no mission. Then, the high-gain antenna makes its move, enabling two-way communications with the ground. No comms, no commands.But all that's kind of easy compared with what comes next.""When I started in this business about 40 years ago, I remember one of the first lessons I got taught was to avoid deployments on orbit,"" said Mike Menzel, Nasa's lead mission systems engineer on the project.""James Webb cannot avoid the deployments. In fact, James Webb has to perform some of the most complex deployment sequences ever attempted, and these come with many challenges.""What if something goes awry? There are no cameras to show what's occurring when the mechanisms are doing their thing. Part of the reasoning for omitting them is that they wouldn't be much use anyway in the dark shadow that's supposed to be cast by the sunshield.So the teams will be relying on sensor feedback, and if a problem arises, they'll work through their ""fault trees"" until a solution is found.In extremis, it's possible even to give the telescope a bit of a shake to free a mechanism that might have become stuck.""When I say, for instance, shimmy, you're rocking the observatory back and forth,"" explained Alphonso Stewart, Nasa's Webb deployment systems lead.""In terms of a twirl, we basically can spin the observatory about any given axis. And for fire and ice, we can orient the observatory in such a way to put the sun on certain areas to heat them up, if we deem that that's necessary for the deployment,"" he told BBC News.Webb is due to enter service about 180 days after launch, a time period that includes tuning the performance of the telescope's mirrors and instruments. But the engineers will not rush their tasks, especially if they come up against a snag.""I've been the Webb project manager for almost 11 years, and this team does not give up,"" said Bill Ochs.""So, we don't talk about what do we do if we fail? We talk about how we correct problems that we see on orbit, and how we move forward from there.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/64/cpsprodpb/3E76/production/_112909951_jonathanamos.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59138682,science
165,Signs of first planet found outside our galaxy,"Astronomers have found hints of what could be the first planet ever to be discovered outside our galaxy.Nearly 5,000 ""exoplanets"" - worlds orbiting stars beyond our Sun - have been found so far, but all of these have been located within the Milky Way galaxy.The possible Saturn-sized planet discovered by Nasa's Chandra X-Ray Telescope is in the Messier 51 galaxy.This is located some 28 million light-years away from the Milky Way.This new result is based on transits, where the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and yields a characteristic dip in brightness that can be detected by telescopes.  This general technique has already been used to find thousands of exoplanets.Dr Rosanne Di Stefano and colleagues searched for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from a type of object known as an X-ray bright binary. These objects typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. The material near the neutron star or black hole becomes superheated and glows at X-ray wavelengths.Because the region producing bright X-rays is small, a planet passing in front of it could block most or all of the rays, making the transit easier to spot.The team members used this technique to detect the exoplanet candidate in a binary system called M51-ULS-1.""The method we developed and employed is the only presently implementable method to discover planetary systems in other galaxies,"" Dr Di Stefano, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US, told BBC News.""It is a unique method, uniquely well-suited to finding planets around X-ray binaries at any distance from which we can measure a light curve.""This binary contains a black hole or neutron star orbiting a companion star with a mass about 20 times that of the Sun. A neutron star is the collapsed core of what had once been a massive star.The transit lasted about three hours, during which the X-ray emission decreased to zero. Based on this and other information, the astronomers estimate that the candidate planet would be around the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance Saturn lies from the Sun.Dr Di Stefano said the techniques that have been so successful for finding exoplanets in the Milky Way break down when observing other galaxies. This is partly because the great distances involved reduce the amount of light which reaches the telescope and also mean that many objects are crowded into a small space (as viewed from Earth), making it difficult to resolve individual stars.With X-rays, she said, ""there may be only several dozen sources spread out over the entire galaxy, so we can resolve them.  In addition, a subset of these are so bright in X-rays that we can measure their light curves.""Finally, the huge emission of X-rays comes from a small region that can be substantially or (as in our case) totally blocked by a passing planet.""The researchers freely admit that more data is needed to verify their interpretation.One challenge is that the planet candidate's large orbit means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, quashing any attempts to make a follow-up observation in the near-term.One other possible explanation that the astronomers considered is that the dimming has been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source.However, they think this is unlikely, because the characteristics of the event do not match up with the properties of a gas cloud.""We know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully,"" said co-author Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University, New Jersey. ""We think we have a strong argument, and this process is how science works.""Dr Di Stefano said that the new generation of optical and infrared telescopes would not be able to compensate for the problems of crowding and dimness, so observations at X-ray wavelengths would likely remain the primary method for detecting planets in other galaxies.However, she said a method known as microlensing might also hold promise for identifying extra-galactic planets.The study has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Astronomy.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15497/production/_121219178_eso0836a.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59044650,science
166,Blue Origin: Jeff Bezos unveils plans for 'space business park',"Blue Origin, the space tourism company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to launch a commercial space station. Bosses said on Monday that they hope to operate the station, named ""Orbital Reef,"" by the end of the decade. Promotional material released by the company claims the station will be a ""mixed-use business park"" in space and will host up to 10 people. The company will partner with Sierra Space and Boeing to build the outpost.Blue Origin said the 32,000 sq ft station would provide customers with an ideal location for ""film-making in microgravity"" or ""conducting cutting-edge research"" and said it would also include a ""space hotel"".At a press conference to launch the initiative, executives from Blue Origin and Sierra Space declined to give an estimate of the building costs, though the project seems assured of heavy funding from Mr Bezos, who has committed to spending $1bn (£726m) a year on Blue Origin. The announcement comes as Nasa searches for proposals to replace the 20-year-old International Space Station (ISS). While funding for the station has been guaranteed until at least 2030, the outpost is in desperate need of repairs. Russian officials have previously warned that its cosmonauts could leave the station by 2025 over fears outdated equipment could trigger a major incident. In response, Nasa announced plans earlier this year to award $400m in private contracts to space companies to help the agency replace the ageing outpost. However, there is likely to be stiff competition for the funding. Earlier this week, a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin announced its own plans to launch a space station into low orbit by 2027. Blue Origin has faced mixed fortunes so far this year. High-profile launches of its New Shepard rocket, which saw Mr Bezos and Star Trek star William Shatner blasted into space, gained significant media attention. But the company has also faced accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace and of turning a blind eye to serious safety concerns from former employees. Last month it missed out on a lucrative $2.9bn Nasa contract which went to billionaire Elon Musk's Space X, one of Blue Origin's chief rivals in the commercial space race.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/00CA/production/_121220200_blueorigin.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59046076,science
167,Orion: Nasa's Moon-ship is attached to SLS megarocket,"Nasa's next-generation spaceship has been lifted onto the rocket that will launch it to the Moon this year or in early 2022.On Wednesday, the Orion spacecraft was attached to the powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.For its upcoming flight, Orion will fly around the Moon without astronauts.But it will eventually carry people as part of a US plan to return people to the lunar surface this decade.This programme is called Artemis - after the sister of Apollo - and could help establish a long-term human presence on Earth's only natural satellite.A crane lifted Orion and then lowered it onto the top of the SLS inside the cuboid Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy.Teams then began work to fully secure the spacecraft to its launcher.On Monday, Orion was transferred to the VAB from another facility where it was being housed, ahead of the operation. It was the last significant piece of hardware waiting to be added to the launch system ahead of the planned test flight.In coming weeks, engineers will also carry out tests on the assembled vehicle, including a rehearsal where the SLS rocket is loaded up with liquid fuel while a launch countdown is simulated.The SLS will launch the Orion spacecraft as part of the uncrewed Artemis-1 mission. This three-week flight will test the SLS and Orion before astronauts are allowed aboard for Artemis-2, which will also loop around the Moon in late 2023.Artemis-3 will see astronauts land on the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Nasa has selected Elon Musk's Starship as the vehicle that will carry humans down from lunar orbit to the surface.Orion will dock with Starship in lunar orbit. Astronauts will then float through a hatch from Orion to Starship to begin preparations to travel down to the lunar surface.The landing mission is currently scheduled for 2024, though many observers expect that date to slip.The metal structure for the Orion spacecraft that will be used for that mission also arrived at Kennedy Space Center this month.This flight will carry the first woman to walk on the surface, along with the next man. The Artemis programme will also see the first person of colour travel to the Moon.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/106B8/production/_121165276_fclfvi5x0aa20dy.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58993527,science
168,South Korea launches first homegrown space rocket Nuri,"South Korea has launched its first homegrown rocket, stepping up the country's ambitions in space.The Korean Satellite Launch Vehicle II, known as Nuri, took off from Goheung, about 500km (310 miles) south of Seoul. President Moon Jae-in said the vehicle completed its full flight sequence but failed in its goal of putting a dummy satellite in orbit. Such launches are essential for a space programme but could potentially also have military applications. South Korea is locked in an arms race with North Korea, with both recently test-firing new weapons. The North put a satellite in orbit in 2012. Nuri cost South Korea an estimated 2 trillion won (£1.23bn or $1.6bn) to develop. Weighing 200 tonnes and measuring 47.2 metres long, it is fitted with six liquid-fuelled engines. In his comments, President Moon admitted the launch fell short of their goals, but added: ""It's not long before we'll be able to launch it exactly into the target trajectory,"" Reuters news agency reported. South Korea plans to carry out four more launches of the Nuri until 2027 to increase reliability, according to the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) that is overseeing the launch.While South Korea is seen as a technological powerhouse, it has lagged behind other countries in its development for space exploration.Previous attempts by Seoul to launch a rocket in 2009 and 2010 failed, with the second exploding minutes after take-off. South Korea is aiming to send a probe to the moon by 2030.While South Korea says it intends to use Nuri to launch satellites, the test has also been viewed as part of the country's ongoing ramp-up in weapons development. Ballistic missiles and space rockets use similar technology. South Korea recently tested a submarine-launched missile. It is also hosting what is said to be its largest ever defence exhibition this week, where it will reportedly unveil a new fighter jet and guided weapons like missiles. Meanwhile North Korea has been carrying out a flurry of weapons tests. In recent weeks, it has launched what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons. Earlier this week, North Korea fired its own submarine-launched missile into the Sea of Japan.Some of these tests by Pyongyang violate international sanctions, as the UN prohibits it from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea also recently held its own defence expo where it showcased its military hardware including tanks and missiles.In Asia, China, Japan and India all have advanced space programmes. Private firms, such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, are also increasingly involved in rocket launches.

169,Sir David Attenborough polar ship makes its London debut,"The UK's new polar research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, has completed basic sea trials and is ready to undertake its first expedition.The vessel came up the Thames on Wednesday through the Woolwich Barrier and is now tied up in Greenwich.It is spending a few days at the home of the Prime Meridian to enable the public to see it, but also to mark the start of the COP26 climate conference.World governments meet in the Scottish city of Glasgow from Sunday.The Attenborough, named after the TV naturalist and BBC presenter Sir David, is the ship the public wanted to call ""Boaty McBoatface"" in an online poll but were overruled by ministers. International senior scientific advisers are using the Attenborough as a platform to issue a statement about the urgent need to address the climate crisis.They want to see a concerted drive to develop - and use - the technologies that will keep global temperature rise to1.5C and underpin the net zero economies of tomorrow.These technologies include better ways of creating, storing and using low-emissions energy - including improving semiconductors, batteries and low-emitting fuel production - as well as work on heating and cooling, and carbon capture and storage.""I think the first thing to say is sticking to 1.5 is both important and achievable,"" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told BBC News.  ""But it's only achievable if we get urgent action. If you work back, for example, from 2050, and ask what you need to do, you can't rely on something coming along late in the day and saving us. It's about utilising the technologies we have now, getting them in place as soon as we can at scale. And that in itself requires R&D (research and development), and making sure that we use both technology, and, of course, natural actions, and the behavioural changes that we all need to take.""  The 129m-long Attenborough has spent the past year in shake-down trials around the British coast.Its first ocean voyage will go to Antarctica for the new austral summer research season.The vessel must deliver supplies to the UK's main scientific base, at Rothera, on the continent's peninsula, as well as to other minor stations dotted around the Southern Ocean.It is expected to head south on or around 18 November.Engineers will want to check its performance in sea-ice, something they haven't had the chance to do.The Attenborough is what's termed a Polar Class 4 icebreaker, which means it should have the strength to crash through metre-thick floes at a steady pace and without damage to its hull.The £200m ship is state of the art. It has a helipad (helicopters are essential for exploration and safety), cranes and onboard labs, and it has an enhanced ability to deploy subs and other ocean-survey and sampling equipment.The Attenborough was the product of lessons learned after decades of operations in the frozen south and north, said Dr Rob Larter.""The way science has progressed means you now have to be able to handle much bigger gear. So, that's why this ship has these very big cranes and gantries,"" the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) marine geophysicist told BBC News.""You also need to be very flexible, because there's so many different sorts of science that people want to do now. We have laboratories that come in containers, like for example a radioisotope lab, an ultra-clean chemistry lab and an experimental aquarium. These can all be added to the ship."" The Attenborough will be at the forefront of understanding how Earth's atmosphere and oceans are warming, and the impacts the temperature rise will have, in particular, on the ice-covered waters and lands of the Arctic and Antarctic.Sir David was present on Thursday to inspect his namesake.His hope, he said, was that world leaders meeting at COP26 would listen to the science and take action to curb global warming. ""I am indeed a very proud man to be standing in this remarkable vessel, to be associated in any way with best, the British Antarctic Survey,"" he told his audience.""May I wish this ship and all who sail in her, and all the scientists who research on board, bon voyage on her forthcoming voyage to the Antarctic. I know that the findings made on this ship in the next few years will be of the greatest value and importance to the welfare of the world. Let us listen to the science.""BAS scientists have already established, for example, how the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, actually helps to shield us from the worst effects of global heating. Oceanographer Dr Emma Boland explained: ""The Southern Ocean takes up about 40% of the carbon dioxide that the oceans as a whole take up, even though it only accounts for 20% of the total ocean surface area. So, it's doing double the work. ""And if that CO2 didn't get taken up by the ocean, it'd be in the atmosphere, and global warming at the surface as we experience it, as human beings, would be that much worse.""The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Scientists have even calculated a value for this ""service"" provided by the Southern Ocean: £60bn per year (€72bn/yr). In other words, if the Southern Ocean didn't exist, this is how much it would cost to remove the CO2 from the atmosphere in a different way.The new Royal Research Ship is tied up to a pontoon in the Thames a short distance from the famous 19th-Century tea clipper, the Cutty Sark.The public won't be able to board the Attenborough, but they will be able to visit an associated exhibition hosted by the Royal Museums Greenwich called ""Ice Worlds"". This will showcase live virtual tours of the polar ship on a big screen, alongside a range of interactive stands.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/64/cpsprodpb/3E76/production/_112909951_jonathanamos.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59022676,science
170,Neutrino result heralds new chapter in physics,"A new chapter in physics has opened, according to scientists who have been searching for a vital building block of the Universe.A major experiment has been used to search for an elusive sub-atomic particle: a key component of the matter that makes up our everyday lives.The search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.This will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.Prof Mark Thomson, the executive chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), which funds the UK's contribution to the Microboone experiment, described the result as ''pretty exciting''.That is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. ''This has been out there for a long time now and generated a lot of interest,'' Prof Thomson told BBC News.''The result is really interesting because it has an influence on emerging theories in particle physics and cosmology.''The Microboone experiment is based at the US Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois - just outside Chicago. But physicists from many countries are involved with the project.Neutrinos are ghostly sub-atomic particles that permeate the Universe, but barely interact with the everyday world around us. Each second, billions of them pass right through the Earth - and everyone living on it.Neutrinos come in three known types, or flavours - the electron, muon and tau. In 1998, Japanese researchers discovered that neutrinos changed from one flavour to another as they travelled.This flavour-flipping cannot fully be explained by the current ""big theory"" of sub-atomic physics - called the Standard Model. Some physicists believe that finding out why the neutrino has such a tiny mass - which is what allows them to change flavour - will give them a deeper understanding of how the Universe works and specifically how it came into being.Current theories suggest that, shortly after the Big Bang, there were equal amounts of matter and its shadowy mirror-image anti-matter. However, when matter collides with anti-matter, they violently annihilate each other, releasing energy.  If there were equal amounts in the early Universe, they should have cancelled each other out.Instead, most of the Universe today is made of matter, with much smaller amounts of anti-matter.Some scientists believe that, contained within the neutrino's flavour-changing, is the cosmic sleight-of-hand that enabled some matter to survive after the Big Bang and create the planets, stars and galaxies that make up the Universe.In the 1990s, an experiment called the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment at the US Department for Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico saw the production of more electron neutrinos than could be explained by the three-neutrino flavour-flipping theory. That result was confirmed by a separate experiment tin 2002.Physicists proposed the existence of a fourth flavour called the sterile neutrino. They believed this form of the particle could explain the over-production of electron neutrinos and, crucially, give an insight into why the particles change flavour. They were named sterile neutrinos because they are predicted not to interact with matter at all, whereas other neutrinos can - though very rarely. Detecting a sterile neutrino would have been a bigger discovery in sub-atomic physics than the Higgs boson because, unlike other forms of neutrino and the Higgs particle, it is not part of the current Standard Model of physics. A team involving nearly 200 scientists from five countries developed and built the Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment, or Microboone, in order to find it. Microboone consists of 150 tonnes of hardware in a space that's the size of a lorry.Its detectors are highly sensitive: its observations of the sub-atomic world have been likened to looking in ultra-high definition.The team has now announced that four separate analyses of data gathered by the experiment show ""no hint"" of the sterile neutrino. But this result is not so much the end of the story, but the beginning of a new chapter.Dr Sam Zeller from Fermilab says that the non-detection does not have to contradict previous findings. ""The earlier data doesn't lie,"" she said.""There's something really interesting happening that we still need to explain. Data is steering us away from the likely explanations and pointing toward something more complex and interesting, which is really exciting.""Prof Justin Evans, from the University of Manchester, believes that the puzzle posed by the latest findings marks a turning point in neutrino research. ""Every time we look at neutrinos, we seem to find something new or unexpected,"" he said. ""Microboone's results are taking us in a new direction, and our neutrino programme is going to get to the bottom of some of these mysteries.""Follow Pallab on Twitter",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ABBB/production/_121236934_machine.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59051779,science
171,Sitting Bull: DNA confirms great-grandson's identity,"A sample of hair belonging to the legendary 19th century Native American leader Sitting Bull has allowed scientists to confirm that a South Dakota man is his great-grandson.Scientists took DNA from a tiny sample of Sitting Bull's hair that had been stored in Washington DC.It showed that Ernie LaPointe, 73, is his great-grandson.The new method allows analysis of family lineages with DNA fragments from long-dead people.It opens the door to the prospect of matching other historic figures to their living descendants.""I feel this DNA research is another way of identifying my lineal relationship to my great-grandfather,"" Mr LaPointe, who has three sisters, told the Reuters news agency.""People have been questioning our relationship to our ancestor as long as I can remember. These people are just a pain in the place you sit - and will probably doubt these findings, also."" The new method was developed by scientists led by Eske Willerslev, director of the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the University of Cambridge.The novel technique is based on what is known as autosomal DNA in the genetic fragments extracted from the hair. It took 14 years to perfect the method. Mr Willerslev said he had been fascinated by Sitting Bull since he was a child and offered his services to Mr LaPointe around a decade ago. Sitting Bull's scalp lock was repatriated to Mr LaPointe by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in 2007. But before handing over the lock, Mr LaPointe asked Mr Willerslev to take part in a ceremony involving a medicine man, drummers and chanting, where Sitting Bull's spirit gave his blessing to the study, the scientist told the AFP news agency.Mr LaPointe burned the majority of the lock - in line with the spirit's instructions - leaving the researchers with just 4cm, which Mr Willerslev believed was ""disastrous"" at the time. However, this forced the team to develop their innovative new method, he said. Sitting Bull, whose real name was Tatanka Iyotake, famously led 1,500 Native American warriors at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, wiping out US General Custer and five companies of soldiers.He was shot dead in 1890 by the ""Indian Police"" acting on behalf of the US government.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14B11/production/_121235748_mediaitem121235747.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59062133,science
172,Astroworld: Victims named as police probe US festival crush,"Family and friends have been paying tribute to those who died following a crowd surge at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas.At least eight people were killed and hundreds hurt at the music event, which is now under investigation by police. Scott has said he is working to help the families of ""the ones that was lost"" after the crowd pressed forward while he was on stage on Friday night.Most of the victims were young people, with the youngest said to be just 14.The family of one victim, 16-year-old Brianna Rodriguez, spoke of their ""profound sadness"" and said the passionate dancer was ""dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"".Earlier, Houston police said their investigation into the crush would include looking into reports that somebody in the audience had been injecting people with drugs.The surge began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday) when panic broke out as the crowd pressed towards the front of the stage during the rapper's headline set.As the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises. On Sunday, GoFund Me pages and emotional social media tributes to those who died were widely shared online. Danish Baig was 27. His brother Basil Mirza Baig posted on Facebook that he had been killed while trying to save another relative in the crush. ""His smile would light up a room"", he wrote. Rudy Peña, from Laredo, Texas, also died in the tragedy. His age has not yet been confirmed. His sister told the Laredo Morning Times that he was ""the sweetest person, friendly, outgoing, he had many friends because he was always there for everyone... he was a big fan of Travis, he loved his music.""Franco Patino, 21, was an engineering student at the University of Dayton. His university confirmed his death to local TV station WHIO. He was also a member of the Alpha Psi Lambda fraternity and completing a work placement in Mason, Ohio. Brianna Rodriguez, 16, was a junior at Heights High School in Houston. ""Dancing was her passion and now she's dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"", her family wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, Houston police Chief Troy Finner said the investigation into the tragedy will include the homicide and narcotics divisions. Teams will review video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. Several concert goers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark.""We do have a report of a security officer... that he was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck,"" Chief Finner said. ""When he was examined he went unconscious,"" he added. ""He was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject.""In his first statement since the event on Twitter, Travis Scott thanked the police and emergency services and said he was ""committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need"".Later he posted a video message on Instagram, in which he encouraged anyone with information about the incident to contact the authorities.Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child - and another one on the way - with socialite Kylie Jenner, who was among the 50,000 people at the festival. She posted on Instagram that they were ""broken and devastated.""""I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing"", she wrote. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to a public disorder charge after he was accused of encouraging people to rush the stage at a concert in the US state of Arkansas. According to a local newspaper, Travis Scott also paid nearly $7,000 (£5,186) to two people who said they were injured at the event.Angelica Casas, BBC News, HoustonA makeshift memorial has been set up along some fencing near the entrance to the festival grounds. Ruby Ayala, 19, came to pay tribute with her family. This was Ayala's first music festival. She went with her sister and some friends - and they made new friends among the crowd. One of them was Franco Patino, who had travelled to Texas from out of state. He has now been confirmed as one of the eight victims.""He had told us he would protect us because he had been to concerts like these before,"" Ayala said in tears. ""I thought to myself, 'I'll just stick with him'.""When the commotion began, they thought it was a mosh pit, a popular dance at music events that involves people pushing against others.

174,UB40 former member Astro dies after short illness,"British vocalist and former member of UB40 Terence Wilson, better known by his stage name Astro, has died aged 64. Astro, who performed in the reggae pop band for more than 30 years, died after a short illness, his current band confirmed.""We are absolutely devastated and completely heartbroken,"" said a statement on Ali Campbell and Astro's Twitter account.""The world will never be the same without him."" Astro joined UB40 in 1979 - shortly after the band was formed - but left in 2013 and went on to perform with breakaway group UB40 featuring Ali Campbell and Astro, which had played some concerts this year and was due to go on tour in 2022.The original band broke through in the early 1980s with their unique take on British reggae and found success with hits like Red Red Wine and Can't Help Falling In Love. The Birmingham-based group - named after the then government's unemployment benefit form - sold more than 70 million records and had three UK number one hits.A statement from the current UB40 line-up on Twitter said: ""RIP Astro.""We have heard tonight, the sad news that ex-member of UB40, Terence Wilson, better know as Astro, has passed away after a short illness. Our sincere condolences to his family.""In total, UB40 have recorded 39 UK top 40 singles and 28 top 40 albums, with Astro singing lead vocals on the hit Rat In Mi Kitchen which reached number 12 in 1987.The group also enjoyed success around the world, including in the US, where Red Red Wine went to number one, as did another cover, Can't Help Falling in Love with You, which spent seven weeks at number one in 1993.The original line-up played together for three decades before Ali Campbell left in 2008.In an interview with the Guardian in May, Astro spoke about the band becoming the voice of working-class people's dissatisfaction with political and global issues after they formed in 1978.He told the paper he experienced the ""same rigmarole as  most black people in the late 70s"", referring to a law which allowed people to be stopped and searched by police if they were deemed to be acting suspiciously - which Astro said was a ""weekly occurrence"". ""We found it harder to write love songs than militant lyrics, because it was a lot easier to write about stuff you had witnessed or read about. It seemed natural to us,"" he added.After the news of Astro's death broke, BBC Radio West Midlands played the UB40 track Sing Our Own Song as a tribute - with presenter Natalie Graham calling his death ""very, very sad"".""Astro really was a wonderful and an incredible human being and obviously the legacy of the music that we still get to enjoy from the likes of UB40 is something very, very special,"" she said.He acquired his nickname as a child because he wore a pair of Dr Martens boots with the model name ""Astronaut"", the musician explained in a 2016 interview with website UK Music Reviews.""Fortunately, no one called me astronaut because it is rather a mouthful so they shortened it to Astro and it has stuck ever since,"" he added.Asked how he felt about touring and performing live, Astro said: ""There is no job on this planet that gives you the job satisfaction that I get. I live to be on stage.""In August, fellow UB40 founding member and saxophonist Brian Travers died of cancer aged 62.Additional reporting by Adam Durbin.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/72AC/production/_121465392_gettyimages-84864134.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59195024,entertainment
175,George Harrison's childhood home up for auction,"The childhood home of George Harrison is up for auction.The Beatles guitarist moved to 25 Upton Green in Speke, Liverpool, in 1949 when he was six years old.He rehearsed with John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the house, which the Harrisons left in 1962 just as the Fab Four were about to hit the big time.Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said the three-bedroom property was ""a steal"" at an estimated price of between £160,000 and £200,000.Harrison, the youngest of four children, previously lived with his parents Harold and Louise - and the family's pet cockerels - in a small house in Arnold Grove, Wavertree.The Harrisons had been on a rehousing list for about 18 years when the opportunity arose to move to the new Speke housing estate.Harrison continued to go to Dovedale Primary School, which was also attended by Lennon - although they were unaware of each other due to the two-and-a-half year age gap.Lennon's skiffle group The Quarrymen rehearsed at 25 Upton Green when he, Harrison and fellow member Paul McCartney were teenagers.The band eventually evolved into The Beatles, the name the members adopted in 1960.The mid-terrace house was last on the market seven years ago, when it was bought by a Beatles fan for £156,000.Although there have been renovations, the house retains some original features, including the bath, sink, doors and outbuildings, Mr Fairweather said.""George will have learned to play the guitar in this house and the photos of the group gathering there in the early 1960s are amazing to see.""He said he was expecting the imminent release of The Beatles: Get Back documentary by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to generate more interest in the sale, adding there was an option to apply for a blue heritage plaque for the property.In 1965, Harrison bought his parents a bungalow in Appleton, near Warrington, with some of the spoils of his international success as a Beatle.After the band's break-up in 1970, he continued to compose and perform and produced films with the Monty Python comedians.Harrison died of cancer at the age of 58 in 2001.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

176,Thomas Hardy: 'Fascinating treasure trove' to be displayed,"Four museums have teamed up to conserve and display rarely seen objects relating to novelist Thomas Hardy.Dorset Museum, Poole Museum, the Salisbury Museum and Wiltshire Museum want to exhibit the largest collection of Hardy items ever displayed at once.Curator Harriet Still described it as a ""fascinating treasure trove"".Among the items set to go on show are a kettle that once belonged to Hardy's grandmother and a tombstone sketch the author created for his dog.The museums, which form the Wessex Museums partnership, aim to crowdfund £5,000 for the exhibition to run across the attractions in the summer. Ms Still, a leading Hardy expert, said: ""Hardy found his inspiration in the landscapes and people of Wessex, but he was also passionate about issues such as women's equality, animal welfare and the unfairness of the English class system. ""As part of the project, I was tasked with exploring the museum stores and finding objects that gave insights into Hardy's complex personality. It was a magical voyage of discovery and it will be wonderful to share this fascinating treasure trove with our visitors.""Julian Fellowes, who is president of the Thomas Hardy Society, said many of the objects had ""remained unseen in museum stores for years"". Lord Fellowes added: ""These personal items will help people come to know Hardy as a man, not just as a writer.""His grandmother's kettle, for example, evokes an image of a young boy sitting by the fireside, listening to the wise old woman's stories; while the tombstone Hardy designed in later life for his beloved dog, Wessex, tells of his deep love for animals.""The money raised will go towards the ""specialist work"" needed to put on the ""ambitious exhibition"", the museums said.Hardy's works include Jude the Obscure, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and Far From the Madding Crowd.One of England's most acclaimed novelists and poets, he was born in Dorset and lived in the county for much of his life.

177,Succession's Brian Cox explains to Starmer why he stopped backing Labour,"There are ""a lot more discussions"" to be had to bring actor Brian Cox, formerly a staunch Labour supporter, back into the party fold, Sir Keir Starmer has said.Mr Cox, who once voiced adverts for the party, switched to the SNP in 2015.The star, appearing alongside Sir Keir on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, said Labour had moved in a ""certain direction"" he disliked.Sir Keir admitted there was a ""lot of hard work to do"" to woo him back.Dundee-born Mr Cox, a famed stage actor and the first man to play serial killer Hannibal Lecter on screen, spoke at former Labour leader John Smith's funeral in 1994 and voiced some of the party's campaigns during the 1990s.Asked by Andrew Marr why he had left, he replied: ""It's a long story and it comes down to what I felt was a failure of social democracy, particularly around 2012, 2010. ""Also the Iraq war - that affected me. [Former Prime Minister Tony] Blair's hubris affected me. And I saw the party going in a certain direction and I was really very concerned, because I am a socialist. I'm riven. I'm very riven about the party.""Mr Cox added: ""I totally agree with Keir on so many things, but [Scotland] was traduced for long enough, time and time again.""The SNP currently holds 45 parliamentary seats in Scotland, compared with just one for Labour. At the 1997 UK election, Labour took 56 seats and the SNP six.Sir Keir said: ""It is certainly true that we have to do a lot of hard work in Scotland.""I think what Brian has said is really the most important thing, which is actually respecting and listening to Scotland has to be an essential part of this, not an afterthought, not a secondary consideration. I think there's space for that discussion.""And I actually do think there's a lot that we would agree on and that is a good basis for building the future. But have we got a lot of work to do?

180,Astroworld: Victims named as police probe US festival crush,"Family and friends have been paying tribute to those who died following a crowd surge at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas.At least eight people were killed and hundreds hurt at the music event, which is now under investigation by police. Scott has said he is working to help the families of ""the ones that was lost"" after the crowd pressed forward while he was on stage on Friday night.Most of the victims were young people, with the youngest said to be just 14.The family of one victim, 16-year-old Brianna Rodriguez, spoke of their ""profound sadness"" and said the passionate dancer was ""dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"".Earlier, Houston police said their investigation into the crush would include looking into reports that somebody in the audience had been injecting people with drugs.The surge began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday) when panic broke out as the crowd pressed towards the front of the stage during the rapper's headline set.As the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises. On Sunday, GoFund Me pages and emotional social media tributes to those who died were widely shared online. Danish Baig was 27. His brother Basil Mirza Baig posted on Facebook that he had been killed while trying to save another relative in the crush. ""His smile would light up a room"", he wrote. Rudy Peña, from Laredo, Texas, also died in the tragedy. His age has not yet been confirmed. His sister told the Laredo Morning Times that he was ""the sweetest person, friendly, outgoing, he had many friends because he was always there for everyone... he was a big fan of Travis, he loved his music.""Franco Patino, 21, was an engineering student at the University of Dayton. His university confirmed his death to local TV station WHIO. He was also a member of the Alpha Psi Lambda fraternity and completing a work placement in Mason, Ohio. Brianna Rodriguez, 16, was a junior at Heights High School in Houston. ""Dancing was her passion and now she's dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"", her family wrote on Facebook. On Saturday, Houston police Chief Troy Finner said the investigation into the tragedy will include the homicide and narcotics divisions. Teams will review video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. Several concert goers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark.""We do have a report of a security officer... that he was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck,"" Chief Finner said. ""When he was examined he went unconscious,"" he added. ""He was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject.""In his first statement since the event on Twitter, Travis Scott thanked the police and emergency services and said he was ""committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need"".Later he posted a video message on Instagram, in which he encouraged anyone with information about the incident to contact the authorities.Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since had eight nominations for Grammy Awards. He has a child - and another one on the way - with socialite Kylie Jenner, who was among the 50,000 people at the festival. She posted on Instagram that they were ""broken and devastated.""""I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing"", she wrote. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to a public disorder charge after he was accused of encouraging people to rush the stage at a concert in the US state of Arkansas. According to a local newspaper, Travis Scott also paid nearly $7,000 (£5,186) to two people who said they were injured at the event.Angelica Casas, BBC News, HoustonA makeshift memorial has been set up along some fencing near the entrance to the festival grounds. Ruby Ayala, 19, came to pay tribute with her family. This was Ayala's first music festival. She went with her sister and some friends - and they made new friends among the crowd. One of them was Franco Patino, who had travelled to Texas from out of state. He has now been confirmed as one of the eight victims.""He had told us he would protect us because he had been to concerts like these before,"" Ayala said in tears. ""I thought to myself, 'I'll just stick with him'.""When the commotion began, they thought it was a mosh pit, a popular dance at music events that involves people pushing against others. But then everyone around them started having trouble breathing and it was hard to get out.They soon lost Patino in the crowd. ""If I would have moved over just a little bit, that could have been me.""Standing in front of the memorial, Ayala's younger sister leans in to hug her. ""It's hard to believe the candles here are also for him.""Ayala's mother, Graciela Martinez, still can't believe her daughters were among the attendees that day. They had called her Friday night right after the festival.""I didn't understand why she was so upset,"" Martinez said, of her daughter's call. ""She forgot to tell me there were people stepping on dead people. It's painful to see that they went through that and there was nothing we (as parents) could do to help them.""Marc Medina, 18, is also back here with his family today. He starts remembering how at the concert he passed by a woman needing help. ""There was this girl and she fell…"" He can't bring himself to continue.""It's not easy to come back here,"" he said. ""But you want people to feel remembered and not forgotten.""Did you witness the incident?

181,UB40 former member Astro dies after short illness,"British vocalist and former member of UB40 Terence Wilson, better known by his stage name Astro, has died aged 64. Astro, who performed in the reggae pop band for more than 30 years, died after a short illness, his current band confirmed.""We are absolutely devastated and completely heartbroken,"" said a statement on Ali Campbell and Astro's Twitter account.""The world will never be the same without him."" Astro joined UB40 in 1979 - shortly after the band was formed - but left in 2013 and went on to perform with breakaway group UB40 featuring Ali Campbell and Astro, which had played some concerts this year and was due to go on tour in 2022.The original band broke through in the early 1980s with their unique take on British reggae and found success with hits like Red Red Wine and Can't Help Falling In Love. The Birmingham-based group - named after the then government's unemployment benefit form - sold more than 70 million records and had three UK number one hits.A statement from the current UB40 line-up on Twitter said: ""RIP Astro.""We have heard tonight, the sad news that ex-member of UB40, Terence Wilson, better know as Astro, has passed away after a short illness. Our sincere condolences to his family.""In total, UB40 have recorded 39 UK top 40 singles and 28 top 40 albums, with Astro singing lead vocals on the hit Rat In Mi Kitchen which reached number 12 in 1987.The group also enjoyed success around the world, including in the US, where Red Red Wine went to number one, as did another cover, Can't Help Falling in Love with You, which spent seven weeks at number one in 1993.The original line-up played together for three decades before Ali Campbell left in 2008.In an interview with the Guardian in May, Astro spoke about the band becoming the voice of working-class people's dissatisfaction with political and global issues after they formed in 1978.He told the paper he experienced the ""same rigmarole as  most black people in the late 70s"", referring to a law which allowed people to be stopped and searched by police if they were deemed to be acting suspiciously - which Astro said was a ""weekly occurrence"". ""We found it harder to write love songs than militant lyrics, because it was a lot easier to write about stuff you had witnessed or read about. It seemed natural to us,"" he added.After the news of Astro's death broke, BBC Radio West Midlands played the UB40 track Sing Our Own Song as a tribute - with presenter Natalie Graham calling his death ""very, very sad"".""Astro really was a wonderful and an incredible human being and obviously the legacy of the music that we still get to enjoy from the likes of UB40 is something very, very special,"" she said.He acquired his nickname as a child because he wore a pair of Dr Martens boots with the model name ""Astronaut"", the musician explained in a 2016 interview with website UK Music Reviews.""Fortunately, no one called me astronaut because it is rather a mouthful so they shortened it to Astro and it has stuck ever since,"" he added.Asked how he felt about touring and performing live, Astro said: ""There is no job on this planet that gives you the job satisfaction that I get. I live to be on stage.""In August, fellow UB40 founding member and saxophonist Brian Travers died of cancer aged 62.Additional reporting by Adam Durbin.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/72AC/production/_121465392_gettyimages-84864134.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59195024,entertainment
182,George Harrison's childhood home up for auction,"The childhood home of George Harrison is up for auction.The Beatles guitarist moved to 25 Upton Green in Speke, Liverpool, in 1949 when he was six years old.He rehearsed with John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the house, which the Harrisons left in 1962 just as the Fab Four were about to hit the big time.Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said the three-bedroom property was ""a steal"" at an estimated price of between £160,000 and £200,000.Harrison, the youngest of four children, previously lived with his parents Harold and Louise - and the family's pet cockerels - in a small house in Arnold Grove, Wavertree.The Harrisons had been on a rehousing list for about 18 years when the opportunity arose to move to the new Speke housing estate.Harrison continued to go to Dovedale Primary School, which was also attended by Lennon - although they were unaware of each other due to the two-and-a-half year age gap.Lennon's skiffle group The Quarrymen rehearsed at 25 Upton Green when he, Harrison and fellow member Paul McCartney were teenagers.The band eventually evolved into The Beatles, the name the members adopted in 1960.The mid-terrace house was last on the market seven years ago, when it was bought by a Beatles fan for £156,000.Although there have been renovations, the house retains some original features, including the bath, sink, doors and outbuildings, Mr Fairweather said.""George will have learned to play the guitar in this house and the photos of the group gathering there in the early 1960s are amazing to see.""He said he was expecting the imminent release of The Beatles: Get Back documentary by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to generate more interest in the sale, adding there was an option to apply for a blue heritage plaque for the property.In 1965, Harrison bought his parents a bungalow in Appleton, near Warrington, with some of the spoils of his international success as a Beatle.After the band's break-up in 1970, he continued to compose and perform and produced films with the Monty Python comedians.Harrison died of cancer at the age of 58 in 2001.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

183,Thomas Hardy: 'Fascinating treasure trove' to be displayed,"Four museums have teamed up to conserve and display rarely seen objects relating to novelist Thomas Hardy.Dorset Museum, Poole Museum, the Salisbury Museum and Wiltshire Museum want to exhibit the largest collection of Hardy items ever displayed at once.Curator Harriet Still described it as a ""fascinating treasure trove"".Among the items set to go on show are a kettle that once belonged to Hardy's grandmother and a tombstone sketch the author created for his dog.The museums, which form the Wessex Museums partnership, aim to crowdfund £5,000 for the exhibition to run across the attractions in the summer. Ms Still, a leading Hardy expert, said: ""Hardy found his inspiration in the landscapes and people of Wessex, but he was also passionate about issues such as women's equality, animal welfare and the unfairness of the English class system. ""As part of the project, I was tasked with exploring the museum stores and finding objects that gave insights into Hardy's complex personality. It was a magical voyage of discovery and it will be wonderful to share this fascinating treasure trove with our visitors.""Julian Fellowes, who is president of the Thomas Hardy Society, said many of the objects had ""remained unseen in museum stores for years"". Lord Fellowes added: ""These personal items will help people come to know Hardy as a man, not just as a writer.""His grandmother's kettle, for example, evokes an image of a young boy sitting by the fireside, listening to the wise old woman's stories; while the tombstone Hardy designed in later life for his beloved dog, Wessex, tells of his deep love for animals.""The money raised will go towards the ""specialist work"" needed to put on the ""ambitious exhibition"", the museums said.Hardy's works include Jude the Obscure, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and Far From the Madding Crowd.One of England's most acclaimed novelists and poets, he was born in Dorset and lived in the county for much of his life. He died in 1928, aged 87.Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

188,George Harrison's childhood home up for auction,"The childhood home of George Harrison is up for auction.The Beatles guitarist moved to 25 Upton Green in Speke, Liverpool, in 1949 when he was six years old.He rehearsed with John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the house, which the Harrisons left in 1962 just as the Fab Four were about to hit the big time.Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said the three-bedroom property was ""a steal"" at an estimated price of between £160,000 and £200,000.Harrison, the youngest of four children, previously lived with his parents Harold and Louise - and the family's pet cockerels - in a small house in Arnold Grove, Wavertree.The Harrisons had been on a rehousing list for about 18 years when the opportunity arose to move to the new Speke housing estate.Harrison continued to go to Dovedale Primary School, which was also attended by Lennon - although they were unaware of each other due to the two-and-a-half year age gap.Lennon's skiffle group The Quarrymen rehearsed at 25 Upton Green when he, Harrison and fellow member Paul McCartney were teenagers.The band eventually evolved into The Beatles, the name the members adopted in 1960.The mid-terrace house was last on the market seven years ago, when it was bought by a Beatles fan for £156,000.Although there have been renovations, the house retains some original features, including the bath, sink, doors and outbuildings, Mr Fairweather said.""George will have learned to play the guitar in this house and the photos of the group gathering there in the early 1960s are amazing to see.""He said he was expecting the imminent release of The Beatles: Get Back documentary by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to generate more interest in the sale, adding there was an option to apply for a blue heritage plaque for the property.In 1965, Harrison bought his parents a bungalow in Appleton, near Warrington, with some of the spoils of his international success as a Beatle.After the band's break-up in 1970, he continued to compose and perform and produced films with the Monty Python comedians.Harrison died of cancer at the age of 58 in 2001.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

189,Thomas Hardy: 'Fascinating treasure trove' to be displayed,"Four museums have teamed up to conserve and display rarely seen objects relating to novelist Thomas Hardy.Dorset Museum, Poole Museum, the Salisbury Museum and Wiltshire Museum want to exhibit the largest collection of Hardy items ever displayed at once.Curator Harriet Still described it as a ""fascinating treasure trove"".Among the items set to go on show are a kettle that once belonged to Hardy's grandmother and a tombstone sketch the author created for his dog.The museums, which form the Wessex Museums partnership, aim to crowdfund £5,000 for the exhibition to run across the attractions in the summer. Ms Still, a leading Hardy expert, said: ""Hardy found his inspiration in the landscapes and people of Wessex, but he was also passionate about issues such as women's equality, animal welfare and the unfairness of the English class system. ""As part of the project, I was tasked with exploring the museum stores and finding objects that gave insights into Hardy's complex personality. It was a magical voyage of discovery and it will be wonderful to share this fascinating treasure trove with our visitors.""Julian Fellowes, who is president of the Thomas Hardy Society, said many of the objects had ""remained unseen in museum stores for years"". Lord Fellowes added: ""These personal items will help people come to know Hardy as a man, not just as a writer.""His grandmother's kettle, for example, evokes an image of a young boy sitting by the fireside, listening to the wise old woman's stories; while the tombstone Hardy designed in later life for his beloved dog, Wessex, tells of his deep love for animals.""The money raised will go towards the ""specialist work"" needed to put on the ""ambitious exhibition"", the museums said.Hardy's works include Jude the Obscure, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and Far From the Madding Crowd.One of England's most acclaimed novelists and poets, he was born in Dorset and lived in the county for much of his life.

190,Succession's Brian Cox explains to Starmer why he stopped backing Labour,"There are ""a lot more discussions"" to be had to bring actor Brian Cox, formerly a staunch Labour supporter, back into the party fold, Sir Keir Starmer has said.Mr Cox, who once voiced adverts for the party, switched to the SNP in 2015.The star, appearing alongside Sir Keir on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, said Labour had moved in a ""certain direction"" he disliked.Sir Keir admitted there was a ""lot of hard work to do"" to woo him back.Dundee-born Mr Cox, a famed stage actor and the first man to play serial killer Hannibal Lecter on screen, spoke at former Labour leader John Smith's funeral in 1994 and voiced some of the party's campaigns during the 1990s.Asked by Andrew Marr why he had left, he replied: ""It's a long story and it comes down to what I felt was a failure of social democracy, particularly around 2012, 2010. ""Also the Iraq war - that affected me. [Former Prime Minister Tony] Blair's hubris affected me. And I saw the party going in a certain direction and I was really very concerned, because I am a socialist. I'm riven. I'm very riven about the party.""Mr Cox added: ""I totally agree with Keir on so many things, but [Scotland] was traduced for long enough, time and time again.""The SNP currently holds 45 parliamentary seats in Scotland, compared with just one for Labour. At the 1997 UK election, Labour took 56 seats and the SNP six.Sir Keir said: ""It is certainly true that we have to do a lot of hard work in Scotland.""I think what Brian has said is really the most important thing, which is actually respecting and listening to Scotland has to be an essential part of this, not an afterthought, not a secondary consideration. I think there's space for that discussion.""And I actually do think there's a lot that we would agree on and that is a good basis for building the future. But have we got a lot of work to do?

191,Marilia Mendonca: Popular Brazil singer dies in plane crash at 26,"Marília Mendonça, one of Brazil's most popular contemporary singers, has been killed in a plane crash at the age of 26, officials say.Four other people - her uncle, her producer and two crew members - also died in the accident in a rural area in south-eastern Minas Gerais state.An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the crash.A Latin Grammy winner in 2019, Mendonça became famous for focusing on women's experiences with failed relationships.One of the biggest names of Brazilian country music known as sertanejo, Mendonça started her career as a teenager, and became a national star in 2016 with a hit about infidelity. She was known as the country's ""Queen of Suffering"".Last year, as concerts were cancelled because of the pandemic, she performed in a series of online gigs. One of them set the record of the most-watched live stream in the world, with 3.3 million peak viewers on YouTube.In 2020, she was the most listened to artist in Brazil on Spotify.Mendonça, who had a two-year-old son, was set to perform at a concert on Friday evening in the city of Caratinga, 12km (seven miles) from the crash site. Hours before the accident, she posted a video on social media in which she prepared to board the private aircraft.The singer's staff had initially said she was alive and well after news of the accident emerged. Television images later showed the damaged aircraft near a waterfall in a mountainous area.After her death was confirmed, Brazilian footballer Neymar said on Twitter: ""I refuse to believe, I refuse"". Singer Anitta said: ""I can't believe it.

192,Beatles manager Brian Epstein to be celebrated with statue,"A new statue of Beatles manager Brian Epstein, showing him walking to see the band, will celebrate his legacy in Liverpool, the team behind it has said.The Brian Epstein Legacy Project wants to place the work on Whitechapel, close to the music impresario's record shop.A spokeswoman said the crowdfunded work would be the first in the city centre to commemorate an LGBT figure.Sculptor Andy Edwards said showing Epstein in full stride was a nod to his Pier Head statues of the Fab Four.Epstein discovered The Beatles in 1961 after seeing them play at the Cavern Club, which was just a short walk from his NEMS Record Store.Sir Paul McCartney would later refer to him as ""the fifth Beatle"".The project spokeswoman said Epstein's five-year deal with the band ""saw them become more professional and guided them not simply to the top of the music charts but into cultural history"". His death in 1967 was ""seen as the beginning of the end for The Beatles"", she added.He was also instrumental in the careers of several other local acts, including Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black, Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas, and Tommy Quickly.The spokeswoman said that ""although his sexuality was not publicly known until after his death, it was well known amongst his friends and business associates [and he] faced many personal challenges"".""Epstein was only 32 when he died and did not live to see the changes that could have impacted on his freedom to publicly express his sexuality [as] laws were changed a month after his death,"" she added. Tom Calderbank, who has led the project, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" to be submitting the plans for the work.""This is a tribute to the hard work, enthusiasm and tenacity of our committee who have spent five years working towards this goal,"" he said.""The Epstein family have supported us from the start, and I'm made up we're able to repay that faith by confirming that Brian will finally be justly honoured in his hometown.""Edwards said his design for the statue was ""intended to be in the same style as our Beatles statues"". ""It relates to them not only in the walking pose, but it maps the short journey Brian would take to The Cavern from his NEMS office, or maybe to meet his boys on the waterfront.""He could also, of course, be off to see Gerry, Billy, Tommy, Michael or Cilla.""Kevin McManus, head of Unesco City of Music in Liverpool, said Epstein ""changed music management forever"".   ""Brian is such an important figure in Liverpool history that it is fitting that his significance is now set to be recognised,"" he added.The planning application will be decided upon by Liverpool City Council later in the year.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

193,"Film & TV: Atlas maps Hogwarts, Jurassic Park & made-up places","So where actually is Batman's Gotham City? Or The Simpsons' Springfield. Do you know where Jurassic Park is? Hogwarts even? One man thinks he does. Well rather than binging on box sets or training for a triathlon, Rhys B Davies has spent the last two years making up a world map of 5,000 fictional film, TV, book and gaming locations. Family Guy's Quahog, Liberty City from Grand Theft Auto and the vicar's Dibley all make the Atlas of Imagined Places.Some places were pretty easy to map.""It's fairly easy to find where the Vicar of Dibley is set, because the opening credits literally start off flying over a particular motorway,"" said Rhys, 35.""And if you can find that location, you can then find where Dibley is meant to be.""But while some made-up locations were relatively straight-forward for Rhys and co-author Matt Brown, others not so much.While Hogwarts School is generally accepted to be located in Scotland, Harry Potter author JK Rowling has never given any precise information about where.But for Rhys and Matt, it was a matter of breaking down the clues left throughout Harry Potter media. ""You got to look for evidence,"" said Rhys, who lives in the very real Welsh seaside town of Aberystwyth.""The first question, of course, is what canon do you follow because the Harry Potter film series puts Hogwarts in the West Highlands,"" said Rhys, adding: ""But the books tell a different story.""We've got a rough idea of when Hogwarts got its railway connection, which meant we were able to look at railway maps and see what lines were open by that period.""We know that it's near Dufftown [Moray, Scotland] because Sirius Black passes through there on his way to Hogwarts from London. ""And crucially, in the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child stage play, Harry's son is able to walk from Hogwarts to Aviemore in less than a night. ""So the result seems to be that Hogwarts is within walking distance of Aviemore. So it's not in the West Highlands. It's in the Grampians.""It is through two years of such painstaking research scouring films, television, novels and video games for clues that Rhys believes that he has pinned down some of the most elusive fictional locations - albeit it's not official.Cartoon hero Fireman Sam's home of Pontypandy was one of the more frustrating places to locate, as Rhys explained.Despite sounding as if it should fit snuggly between Pontypridd and Tonypandy, the newest iteration of the show places it on the coast. ""The only real way we could reconcile this... was to stick it in the Vale of Glamorgan,"" Rhys said.Unlike real locations, fictional places have a tendency to move around, or not stay entirely consistent over time.In The Poseidon Adventure, the SS Poseidon ship sinks in three different oceans between the novel in 1969, the original film in 1972 and its 2005 and 2006 adaptations.Similarly inconsistent is Batman's Gotham City, which has had a fairly established location for years until a recent film positioned the city directly across the water from Superman's home city of Metropolis.""We went with what maps in the comics had shown, which put them a little way apart, and enough room for intervening communities that we actually know exist,"" said Rhys.When sources contradict each other, the general rule is that the ""one that works the best or the one that seems to be the most consistent"" is the one that makes it on the map.Maps generally help get you from one place to another, so what good is a map that shows places that do not exist?Rhys was just looking to work on something with a mate.He joined up with his friend Matt to create a map of fake Britain years ago and ""that went down a treat"" he recalled. They then went on to map out an in-depth look at the streets of London.""After both of those worked out so well, we thought let's get ambitious, let's try and do the whole planet,"" added Rhys.

194,How pop star Zara Larsson made a seven-figure sum on Roblox,"Pop star Zara Larsson says she's made a seven-figure sum by selling merchandise on the video game platform Roblox.The Swedish star, known for hits like Lush Life and Symphony, offers fans in-game items like hats, backpacks and sunglasses to dress up their avatars.With prices starting at less than £1, Larsson says it's ""freaking insane"" to have earned more than $1m (£740,000) since joining the platform in May.""My jaw dropped when I heard,"" the star tells the BBC. As parents around the world will know, Roblox is not so much a game as a gaming universe.Once logged in, users become blocky online characters and cultivate their own areas, setting challenges and creating obstacle courses for friends and strangers to complete. They pay a virtual currency called Robux to dress up their avatars or decorate stages, and often use the game as a place to hang out with friends - particularly during the pandemic.It is not without its critics. There have been concerns over children seeing sexually explicit and violent content inside the app, although the company has strict rules against adult material, and recently introduced an age verification system.The in-game marketplace can also be a source of tension for parents, with documented cases of children spending thousands of pounds on in-game items.Larsson first teamed up with Roblox to promote her new album, Poster Girl, when concerts were cancelled during the pandemic.She hosted a virtual ""dance party"" within the game in May, allowing fans to hang out, watch her perform, and take part in an online scavenger hunt.They could also buy outfits, hairstyles, dance moves and a customisable Zara Larsson avatar. Prices started at 60 Robux (approximately £0.67) rising to 400 Robux (£4.95) for the star's likeness.The merchandise was initially an afterthought, the singer says.""I didn't really think much about it. It wasn't really the motivation for the concert. I just wanted to connect with fans.""Needless to say, she's a convert now. In fact, Larsson says in-game concerts and virtual merchandise could be a lifeline for musicians at a time when CD sales have crumbled, touring is uncertain, and streaming royalties aren't compensating artists fairly.""We all know this,"" she says. ""Streaming services don't pay the most.""To make a seven-figure sum from YouTube or Spotify ""would take a long, long time and hundreds and millions of streams,"" she observes.But the attraction isn't solely financial. Larsson's Roblox show attracted more than 1.6 million users, who made more than four million visits to her pink, Swedish lake house-themed world. Many of those are fans who couldn't travel to a concert venue, or afford a concert ticket. Some even heard Larsson's music for the first time.""A lot of young people are commenting on my social media, 'Oh my God it's the Roblox girl!'"" she laughs. ""It's incredible. That's how they found out about me even though I've been doing this for 10 years.""With the COP26 climate summit taking place this week, she's also aware that virtual shows could greatly reduce her carbon footprint.""Imagine how many flights it would take to reach four million people? Or how many trucks it would take to bring a pink lake house with me everywhere?""And then having a couple of hundred people on a payroll, who also need accommodation and food and somewhere to sleep. ""Going online saves so much in carbon emissions.""The music industry expects that live streams and virtual concert experiences will continue to be a growth area, even after pandemic-related restrictions allow full-scale touring to resume.Fortnite and Minecraft have also conducted successful experiments with in-game gigs, featuring major artists like Travis Scott, Ariana Grande and Charli XCX.The technology can still be rudimental - US pop star Ava Max accidentally walked her character into a pit of lava and died while performing inside Roblox last year - but the experience is improving all the time, says Roblox's global head of music, Jonathan Vlassopulos.""We've got close to 50 million people on the platform every day - and once the penny drops that fans are hanging out for two or three hours a day in the metaverse, I think we'll see an explosion of artists joining,"" he says.""We're not limited by gravity and space, so we can build magical worlds and more high fidelity [experiences]"".But surely an in-game concert can never replicate the visceral feeling of playing to 500 fans, all crammed together in a sweaty club?""Of course from my perspective, it could be better, and maybe we'll get there one day,"" says Larsson. ""But until then it's a beautiful way of having an emotional connection. ""After my show, I wandered around the world and people were like, 'Let me take a selfie with you!'""I didn't get it at first - but then they just put their avatar really close to mine, and took a screenshot and that's the selfie. ""And yeah, that could be hard for my generation to understand - but for people who live their lives online and are being social online, it means as much to them as meeting me on the street.""It's really made me think about what touring could look like in the future.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

195,Voyage: 'Vintage Abba' or 'bafflingly retrograde' - comeback album splits opinion,"Forty years after their last studio album, Abba have made one of the most anticipated comebacks in music with the release of their new record, Voyage.The 10-track album has divided opinion among critics, however.""It's vintage Abba, on par with their classic 1970s run,"" declared Rolling Stone in a four-star review.But The Guardian's two-star write-up warned that Voyage is a ""disappointment"" that languishes in ""often bafflingly retrograde settings"".The album comes two months after the Swedish pop legends released the first two new songs, I Still Have Faith In You and Don't Shut Me Down.The Guardian's Jude Rogers said ""the glamour promised by this album's two terrific singles goes horribly unfulfilled"".""Rather than reflecting poignantly on the past, much of the rest of Voyage feels terminally stuck there.""Of the album tracks, When You Danced With Me provokes ""mild nausea"" while a Christmas song called Little Things, which is third on the track list, is a ""big crime against sense, sentimentality and sequencing"", she said.""If only they had stopped at those two knowing songs, leaving the rest to our dazzling imaginations.""Even Rolling Stone filed Little Things under ""stomach-churning filler"".""But otherwise,"" the magazine's critic Rob Sheffield wrote, ""Voyage reflects how far these four have travelled, musically and emotionally.""There's no embarrassing attempt to get up to date with the bops the kids are into these days, a compliment to their integrity.""Voyage ""piles on the tragic drama"", he wrote. ""It's a whole album of The Winner Takes It All, without any Mamma Mia or Take a Chance On Me.""He concluded: ""It's a surprise to have these Swedes back in the game. But it's a bigger, sweeter surprise that they returned so full of musical vitality.""The Independent's Helen Brown gave Voyage five stars and agreed that it was ""a triumphant album awash with Abba's gung-ho uncoolness"" that ""delivers all the classic Abba flavours"".""Abba haven't tried to update the gloriously gaudy vintage tinsel of their 80s office party sound,"" she said. ""[Bjorn] Ulvaeus and [Benny] Andersson have always been canny businessmen and they know their appeal has never been about being 'on trend'.""The Times' critic Ed Potton described Voyage as ""a reassuringly familiar blend of clear-eyed sentiment, outrageous musicality and utter indifference to fashion"".He wrote: ""Like much of Abba's back catalogue, these songs can sound naff on first listen, yet you're pulled in by Benny Andersson's melodic oomph and Bjorn Ulvaeus's eccentric lyrical insights.""Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad share the lead vocals, and their voices, though a touch lower, remain pristine and moving.""Despite the piano on Just A Notion being ""dangerously reminiscent of Shakin' Stevens"", Potton alluded to the lyrics of I Still Have Faith In You when he concluded: ""Do they have it in them? On the strength of these 10 songs, it's a resounding yes.""The i newspaper's Kate Solomon referred to the same lyric, but came up with a different answer.""Do they have it in them? Sadly, the answer on Voyage is no,"" she wrote.It is a ""strange, confused record"", she explained.""It feels like we've been promised paradigm-shifting new material and ended up with a load of B-sides and rarities...""There's a sort of Sound of Music feel to the whole endeavour; a slightly daggy, overly sentimental attempt at recapturing something that had already been lost.""The Telegraph's Neil McCormick said Faltskog and Lyngstad ""can still hold a tune"", while Andersson and Ulvaeus ""have not lost their ability to craft a flowing melody adorned with glittering hooks"".""Voyage is a gentle OAP cruise around the backwaters of Abba's reputation,"" he wrote.The New Statesman's Kate Mossman said she was ""repeatedly struck by the bizarre tone of late-period Abba's domestic psychodramas"".""Abba do a great line in mature romance, though - a kind of knowing, twinkly-eyed boomer romance you don't see anywhere else apart from on ads for life insurance.""Andersson told BBC News that ""we don't need to prove anything here"", adding: ""I don't think we're taking a risk because if people think that we were better 40 years ago, fine.""He said he thinks Voyage will be the quartet's swansong. ""I've said that's it,"" he told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""I don't want to do another Abba album.""But I'm not alone in this. There are four of us. If they twist my arm, I might change my mind.""Ulvaeus added: ""I never say never, but I agree with Benny. I think that was our goodbye.""The band will, however, continue in the form of animated digital avatars dubbed Abbatars, which will ""perform"" at virtual concerts in a specially-constructed arena in London from next May.On Thursday, they released a trailer giving an idea of how the shows will look.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1274F/production/_120399557_5830ee6a-d137-4ab3-91a6-1a139ccba4c8.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59175090,entertainment
196,Give Us A Clue to Extras: The life of Lionel Blair,"Lionel Blair will be remembered as a variety entertainer of the old school, whose mischievous wit, flamboyance and ever-twinkling eye kept him popular whatever the decade. His self-taught talent as a dancer and choreographer made him famous, taking him from child performer to Sammy Davis Jr's dance-off competitor in front of the Queen Mother. But in a career spanning more than 70 years, Blair also did a lot of acting, especially in the early years. And he worked with, or counted as friends, myriad showbusiness legends including Bob Hope, The Beatles and Liza Minnelli. As the decades advanced, Blair popped up as a (non-dancing) guest on multiple popular TV programmes - quiz show Blankety Blank to name but one. And most people knew him as an ever-present celebrity who danced a bit, as opposed to a celebrity dancer.  It was his role as a team captain on the 1980s Give Us A Clue game show which became his calling card, even though he later ventured into reality TV, including an infamous PVC-clad turn in Celebrity Big Brother.And though he also became a would-be retiree of The Real Marigold Hotel, there was never any thought of disappearing into anonymity for Blair. The chat show invites kept coming, as did the tours, played up and down the UK.""People still say, almost in a derogatory way, 'Oh, you're a dancer'. Or, 'You're so showbiz',"" he said in 2018. ""Well what's wrong with that? I am. I love it. I'm thrilled to have been part of showbiz for so many years.""Henry Lionel Blair Ogus, to give him his original full name, got an early start to life in the spotlight. He was born in Montreal in 1928, the son of a Jewish barber who had emigrated from Russia to Canada. Blair's father moved the family to London and, when World War Two broke out, Henry Lionel and his older sister Joyce began entertaining people in air raid shelters with their improvised dance routines.  ""From an early age Joyce and I were taken to the pictures - it was always Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or Shirley Temple,"" Blair once recounted, explaining where his inspiration had come from. ""We used to go home and try to copy them. That's how we learned to tap dance.""  At 13, Blair was devastated by the death of his father. ""It changed everything... I don't think I've ever experienced loss like it,"" he said.With no family breadwinner, he began working as an actor. He then teamed up again with Joyce in musical productions before flying solo and making his acting debut aged 14 in Watch on the Rhine.  The Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford followed. And as Blair's acting career progressed, he performed Stoppard and Ayckbourn. But it was as a dancer that he was to excel. In the 1960s, he came to public attention after forming the troupe Lionel Blair and His Dancers, who became regulars on TV variety shows.A career defining moment came in 1961 when Blair stepped onto the stage of London's Prince of Wales Theatre for the Royal Variety Command Performance - accompanied by none other than Sammy Davis Jr.They went on to perform a bizarre comedy sketch which saw ""Savile Row shop assistant"" Blair teach ""gauche American"" Davis how to be posh. As the act progressed, the dancing became competitive, as the duo bid to out-dance each other. Neither did and Davis Jr and Blair became lifelong friends. ""It was the highlight of my career... that was one of the most thrilling things, ever. He was just so kind to me. He gave me a silver dollar. I carry it with me all the time,"" Blair later recalled. An appearance as a choreographer in the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night in 1964 enhanced his reputation and he choreographed other films such as The Magic Christian in 1969. In 1967, Blair married his wife Susan. The couple went on to have three children and three grandchildren. Blair later revealed on ITV's Loose Women how he had stolen his future wife from his friend after a ""Cupid's arrow"" moment at a dinner party.""I walked in the room and honestly, I took one look at her and it hit me. I thought, 'That's the girl I am going to marry'... six weeks later we were married,"" Blair told the audience.""The secret of a successful marriage is memories... that's why my dad insisted that we went everywhere together, so we could talk about things. I'm so lucky to have a wife who is a nest builder. Her nest is the most important thing in the world to her,"" he also told the Guardian. ""We've got a very, very normal family, and for me everything comes back to family. If they're sad, I'm sad. I want them to be happy all the time."" On TV shows in the 1970s, Blair was often roped in to choreograph and/or perform. ""Everybody said: 'Give us a twirl, Lionel'. If that's what they want, that's what they're going to get,"" he later joked about his hoofer's reputation.He built on his growing status as a household name with frequent spots on primetime family programmes such as The Tommy Cooper Hour and the Jimmy Tarbuck Show.Towards the end of the decade, Blair had established his celebrity to such an extent that he became a judge on ITV's X-Factor forerunner New Faces in 1976.But it was in the 1980s that Blair earned a cosier affection as a star of TV games shows Name That Tune and the charades hit, Give Us A Clue. The women's team captain was Una Stubbs and the series featured a galaxy of famous team players. ""We did well over 1,000 shows between 1979 and 1982,"" Blair later proudly recalled.  In the mid-90s, Blair became the butt of lewd gay Give Us A Clue jokes on Radio 4's I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. They went on for nearly 15 years, made originally by host Humphrey Lyttelton and continued by his successor Jack Dee. The audience loved it. Blair himself was less amused. ""It was merciless and just plain mean. I didn't mind for myself but my wife and family really hated it and became very upset,"" he told the Mirror. ""I don't understand why they had to be gay gags either. Yes, I'm very over-the-top and flamboyant but I always have been. I'm theatrical, darling!""I could have sued, I suppose, but that would have been breaking the comedians' code - and you simply don't do that.""Established as a ""good get"" for a many a TV show, Blair continued to turn up regularly on a range of programmes - frequently as himself. They included Channel Five's The Farm, sending himself up in the final episode of Ricky Gervais' Extras in 2007, a one-off spot in Emmerdale and an outrageous spell in the Celebrity Big Brother house.  In 2007, Blair was diagnosed with and recovered from prostate cancer. There were also some bizarre non-career related episodes in his colourful life, including the kidnap of his pet dog Florence in 2006, the same year he and the comedian Alan Carr saved a man who was about to fall from Blackpool pier. Late into his life, Blair continued to appear in pantomimes and gigs on game and chat shows. He toured the UK in both group and solo productions, including Tap & Chat With Lionel Blair, a convivial trawl through the variety performer's life and times. His decision to check into The Real Marigold Hotel in India was driven by his dancer's competitiveness. ""I signed up... because of the show that I saw before - I thought if Wayne Sleep can do it, I can do it!,"" he said. If anything, the show proved that, for Blair, life in all its infinite variety is for living - no matter your age. There is, he said, ""something exciting around every corner"". ""I've been in this business since I was 13 and it's given me a wonderful life.""

197,"Schitt's Creek's Dan Levy on memes, representation and 'Ew David'","Even if you haven't watched it, there's a good chance the characters of Schitt's Creek have turned up on your phone - in your social feeds or in your WhatsApp groups.The TV show has won prestigious awards and critical acclaim, but some of its most successful marketing has come from memes.""I feel like the internet world almost caught on before the TV world did,"" the series co-creator and star, Dan Levy, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.The show is shown in dozens of countries around the world, and has proved irresistibly binge-worthy. ""We had an incredible social media manager through the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,"" says Dan.""He was the person who initially put up all of that content online. I think it was the end of season two or three when he mentioned one meme or gif that had been viewed a billion times.""If you've only seen the out-of-context internet stuff then it's probably time for a quick explanation.Dan plays David Rose, the son in a billionaire family who lose everything and end up living in a motel in a remote town.David is used to a completely over-the-top life in his luxury New York apartment but, all of a sudden, he's sharing a motel room with his sister, Alexis, who's played by Annie Murphy.Initially, the audience wasn't supposed to like the Rose family. ""We had the luxury of spending an entire first season showing who these people were in order to slowly, but surely, reveal who they are becoming,"" says Dan.""I'm very grateful that people stayed because the first season is showing these characters at their worst,"" he adds.Dan's just released a book called Best Wishes, Warmest Regards: The Story Of Schitt's Creek which looks at all six series and 80 episodes of the comedy. He's written it with the guy he also co-created the show with: his real life and on-screen dad, Eugene Levy. The show's cult following even helped write the book with fans ""knowing more about the show"" than Dan did. ""It's both embarrassing for me and a compliment to them,"" he says.""There was one Instagram account called Schitt's Sheets which documented in great detail, through a variety of spreadsheets, information about our show - from the number of times that people hugged each other, to the various variations that I wore my rings, to the number of times that Alexis said 'ew' in the show.""Alexis only says ""ew, David"" a handful of times in the entire thing, so what's become a catchphrase of hers in the world of memes isn't actually a massive part of the TV character.""I think that's the big revelation for a lot of people as they think it's been spoken 1,000 times,"" Dan says.""The truth is she said things like 'ew, stop' or 'ew, no' a lot more.""As well as internet legacies, Dan wants his show to be remembered for other reasons including David's pansexuality - which means he's attracted to people regardless of their gender.""A lot of the stories I see representing my community are cautionary tales or lessons to be learned, or something that's kind of heavy handed and waterlogged with messaging,"" Dan says.""Very rarely do members of the LGBTQIA+ community get to see themselves represented in really hopeful and happy ways.""It's about presenting people for who they are, and allowing people to see those people and warm to those people and love those people.""Dan also let Newsbeat in on something fans have been wildly speculating about since a picture surfaced of him out to dinner with Antman star, Paul Rudd, a few weeks ago. People hoped the meeting might mean Dan's in the third Antman film - but they were wrong.""What came from that photo was essentially that I look much older than him, that we are best friends and that I am in Antman 3,"" he says.""Unfortunately, he is not younger than me, we are not best friends and I am not sadly in Antman 3.""Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5E9/production/_121335926_schittscreekmaincast.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-59149046,entertainment
