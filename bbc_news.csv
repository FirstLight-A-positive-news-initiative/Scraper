0,World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - report,"Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.COP26 ""has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.COP26 is expected to finish this week.The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. So how has the confusion come about?The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on.

2,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,science
3,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

4,Obama tells young people to stay angry on climate fight,"Barack Obama has called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit.The former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way.Mr Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe.He criticised Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"", but said the US is ready to lead again.Mr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit.Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists.He called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made in the 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. However, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, including the failure of a key promise by developed countries to deliver $100bn (£73bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.Perhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English.He admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead.Mr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were ""right to be frustrated"".Addressing young people directly, he said they ""can't ignore politics"" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level.""You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics].""Referencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not.Obama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to ""stay angry"".""To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,"" he said.""But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint.""He honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are ""forming movements across borders"", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change.""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does"", he said.The former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change.Mr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change ""an expensive hoax"" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden.Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by ""sitting on the sidelines"" and making climate change a partisan issue with ""four years of active hostility toward climate science"".He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are ""a rare breed right now."" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit.Mr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis.Taking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was ""particularly discouraging"" that the leaders of ""two of the world's largest emitters"" had not attended the climate summit in person.While more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead.Mr Obama said they were showing a ""dangerous lack of urgency"".The 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with ""every victory incomplete"".""The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we can do hard things again.""Barack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. He touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't ""real happy"" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. He lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. He heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future.It was a delicate balance for a former president who made ""hope and change"" his trademark line. But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

5,Rich countries ‘pushing back’ on paying for climate loss,"Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change.Poorer countries see it as critical that money for loss and damage be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it.Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued.Developing countries argue that rich countries are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting carbon much earlier than the rest of the world.""Loss and damage is still a taboo for developed countries,"" said Alpha Oumar Kaloga, one of the lead negotiators of the Africa Group, who also represents Guinea in the Least Developed Countries bloc (LDC). The majority of the 46 countries in the LDC bloc are in Africa.""During negotiations, we have been repeatedly arguing that loss and damage needs to be mentioned in a separate column in the climate finance reporting papers of developed countries, because such losses and damages are happening all over the world,"" Mr Kaloga said.The resistance from rich countries behind closed doors is particularly frustrating when they are at the same time ""talking about transparency in this whole process.""A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) this year showed that in 2019, about 25% of climate finance from developed countries went towards adaptation - preparing for extreme weather events, or building seawalls, for example - while the rest went to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions.Poor countries say climate change is impacting on communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away.As holder of the COP presidency, the UK has been co-ordinating the talks. A spokesperson said the UK was ""listening to the views of all parties and the final text will be agreed by consensus"". Le-Anne Roper, lead negotiator on loss and damage for the Alliance of Small Island States, wants a new finance goal just for loss and damage. This would be separate from the $100bn (£74bn) already pledged - a target the world has already missed for 2020 which is now set for 2023.""It is the only way we will be able to give our people a better chance at surviving, given the growing scale of the crisis and the need for significant action to address loss and damage,"" she told the BBC.Harjeet Singh, senior adviser for Climate Action Network International, said climate change was destroying entire communities.""This is about providing relief, rehabilitation and support to those who are simply displaced forever,"" he said.There were no immediate comments from loss and damage negotiators from some developed countries contacted by the BBC.There has been criticism from developing countries that adaptation has not received enough attention at COP26, and that the agenda has been dominated by carbon emissions reduction which has to do mainly with developed nations and fast-emerging economies like China and India.   Several poor countries have also come under criticism for not making best use of the funds made available to them. Experts say issues like bad governance and corruption have been a major challenge in implementing adaptation projects.

6,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. ""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. ""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.""The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.""""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.""Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings.

7,World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - report,"Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.COP26 ""has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.COP26 is expected to finish this week.The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. So how has the confusion come about?The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13965/production/_121492208_untitled6.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59220687,80,2021-11-09T14:01:50.000Z,science
8,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,science
9,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

10,Obama tells young people to stay angry on climate fight,"Barack Obama has called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit.The former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way.Mr Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe.He criticised Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"", but said the US is ready to lead again.Mr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit.Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists.He called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made in the 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. However, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, including the failure of a key promise by developed countries to deliver $100bn (£73bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.Perhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English.He admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead.Mr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were ""right to be frustrated"".Addressing young people directly, he said they ""can't ignore politics"" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level.""You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics].""Referencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not.Obama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to ""stay angry"".""To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,"" he said.""But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint.""He honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are ""forming movements across borders"", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change.""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does"", he said.The former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change.Mr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change ""an expensive hoax"" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden.Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by ""sitting on the sidelines"" and making climate change a partisan issue with ""four years of active hostility toward climate science"".He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are ""a rare breed right now."" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit.Mr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis.Taking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was ""particularly discouraging"" that the leaders of ""two of the world's largest emitters"" had not attended the climate summit in person.While more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead.Mr Obama said they were showing a ""dangerous lack of urgency"".The 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with ""every victory incomplete"".""The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we can do hard things again.""Barack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. He touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't ""real happy"" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. He lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. He heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future.It was a delicate balance for a former president who made ""hope and change"" his trademark line. But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

11,Rich countries ‘pushing back’ on paying for climate loss,"Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change.Poorer countries see it as critical that money for loss and damage be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it.Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued.Developing countries argue that rich countries are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting carbon much earlier than the rest of the world.""Loss and damage is still a taboo for developed countries,"" said Alpha Oumar Kaloga, one of the lead negotiators of the Africa Group, who also represents Guinea in the Least Developed Countries bloc (LDC). The majority of the 46 countries in the LDC bloc are in Africa.""During negotiations, we have been repeatedly arguing that loss and damage needs to be mentioned in a separate column in the climate finance reporting papers of developed countries, because such losses and damages are happening all over the world,"" Mr Kaloga said.The resistance from rich countries behind closed doors is particularly frustrating when they are at the same time ""talking about transparency in this whole process.""A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) this year showed that in 2019, about 25% of climate finance from developed countries went towards adaptation - preparing for extreme weather events, or building seawalls, for example - while the rest went to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions.Poor countries say climate change is impacting on communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away.As holder of the COP presidency, the UK has been co-ordinating the talks. A spokesperson said the UK was ""listening to the views of all parties and the final text will be agreed by consensus"". Le-Anne Roper, lead negotiator on loss and damage for the Alliance of Small Island States, wants a new finance goal just for loss and damage. This would be separate from the $100bn (£74bn) already pledged - a target the world has already missed for 2020 which is now set for 2023.""It is the only way we will be able to give our people a better chance at surviving, given the growing scale of the crisis and the need for significant action to address loss and damage,"" she told the BBC.Harjeet Singh, senior adviser for Climate Action Network International, said climate change was destroying entire communities.""This is about providing relief, rehabilitation and support to those who are simply displaced forever,"" he said.There were no immediate comments from loss and damage negotiators from some developed countries contacted by the BBC.There has been criticism from developing countries that adaptation has not received enough attention at COP26, and that the agenda has been dominated by carbon emissions reduction which has to do mainly with developed nations and fast-emerging economies like China and India.   Several poor countries have also come under criticism for not making best use of the funds made available to them. Experts say issues like bad governance and corruption have been a major challenge in implementing adaptation projects.

12,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. ""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. ""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.""The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.""""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.""Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP.""The likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,"" said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis. ""If we're serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.""The BBC asked the UN body responsible for accrediting delegates about its procedures, but has not received a reply.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/919A/production/_121147273_3_fossil_fuel_getty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484,80,2021-11-08T00:14:06.000Z,science

""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,science
14,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

15,Obama tells young people to stay angry on climate fight,"Barack Obama has called on young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit.The former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way.Mr Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe.He criticised Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"", but said the US is ready to lead again.Mr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit.Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists.He called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made in the 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. However, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, including the failure of a key promise by developed countries to deliver $100bn (£73bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.Perhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the ""Emerald Isles"", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English.He admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead.Mr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were ""right to be frustrated"".Addressing young people directly, he said they ""can't ignore politics"" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level.""You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics].""Referencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not.Obama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to ""stay angry"".""To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,"" he said.""But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint.""He honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are ""forming movements across borders"", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change.""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does"", he said.The former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change.Mr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change ""an expensive hoax"" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden.Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by ""sitting on the sidelines"" and making climate change a partisan issue with ""four years of active hostility toward climate science"".He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are ""a rare breed right now."" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit.Mr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis.Taking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was ""particularly discouraging"" that the leaders of ""two of the world's largest emitters"" had not attended the climate summit in person.While more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead.Mr Obama said they were showing a ""dangerous lack of urgency"".The 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with ""every victory incomplete"".""The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we can do hard things again.""Barack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. He touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't ""real happy"" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. He lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. He heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future.It was a delicate balance for a former president who made ""hope and change"" his trademark line. But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

16,Rich countries ‘pushing back’ on paying for climate loss,"Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change.Poorer countries see it as critical that money for loss and damage be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it.Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued.Developing countries argue that rich countries are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting carbon much earlier than the rest of the world.""Loss and damage is still a taboo for developed countries,"" said Alpha Oumar Kaloga, one of the lead negotiators of the Africa Group, who also represents Guinea in the Least Developed Countries bloc (LDC). The majority of the 46 countries in the LDC bloc are in Africa.""During negotiations, we have been repeatedly arguing that loss and damage needs to be mentioned in a separate column in the climate finance reporting papers of developed countries, because such losses and damages are happening all over the world,"" Mr Kaloga said.The resistance from rich countries behind closed doors is particularly frustrating when they are at the same time ""talking about transparency in this whole process.""A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) this year showed that in 2019, about 25% of climate finance from developed countries went towards adaptation - preparing for extreme weather events, or building seawalls, for example - while the rest went to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions.Poor countries say climate change is impacting on communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away.As holder of the COP presidency, the UK has been co-ordinating the talks. A spokesperson said the UK was ""listening to the views of all parties and the final text will be agreed by consensus"". Le-Anne Roper, lead negotiator on loss and damage for the Alliance of Small Island States, wants a new finance goal just for loss and damage. This would be separate from the $100bn (£74bn) already pledged - a target the world has already missed for 2020 which is now set for 2023.""It is the only way we will be able to give our people a better chance at surviving, given the growing scale of the crisis and the need for significant action to address loss and damage,"" she told the BBC.Harjeet Singh, senior adviser for Climate Action Network International, said climate change was destroying entire communities.""This is about providing relief, rehabilitation and support to those who are simply displaced forever,"" he said.There were no immediate comments from loss and damage negotiators from some developed countries contacted by the BBC.There has been criticism from developing countries that adaptation has not received enough attention at COP26, and that the agenda has been dominated by carbon emissions reduction which has to do mainly with developed nations and fast-emerging economies like China and India.   Several poor countries have also come under criticism for not making best use of the funds made available to them. Experts say issues like bad governance and corruption have been a major challenge in implementing adaptation projects.

17,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. ""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. ""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.""The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.""""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.""Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP.""The likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,"" said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis. ""If we're serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.""The BBC asked the UN body responsible for accrediting delegates about its procedures, but has not received a reply.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/919A/production/_121147273_3_fossil_fuel_getty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484,80,2021-11-08T00:14:06.000Z,science
18,How the world is reacting to the climate summit,"It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.It's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New YorkPresident Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that ""put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as ""isolated holdouts"" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: ""Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.""There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.Go compare. A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are ""positive consequences of global warming"" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.There's no sense here of a climate emergency. Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a ""smooth"" (longer) transition to greener energy.""Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,"" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. ""I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet."" India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, ""India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions"" - a line that many here applauded. The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a ""bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West"". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept ""sledging"" or ""slurs"". And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.""Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,"" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. ""And it was never more on show than this week as he sold ""the Australian Way"" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.""Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A ""terribly messy week"" for the prime minister.The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in São Paulo.Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like São Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. It's not that Brazilians don't care.""People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,"" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. ""What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,"" Ms Cervellini says. And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.""If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,"" she says. ""We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.""Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, ""there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions"".However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed ""persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as ""enough evidence"".But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by ""demonising"" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/48DF/production/_121455681_gettyimages-1228386010.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59036722,80,2021-11-06T00:41:57.000Z,science
19,What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?,"Countries are setting out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.They hope to achieve the target of ""net zero"" by 2050, to help slow global warming.Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises ""well below"" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Experts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.Almost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.Carbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. This involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.However, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.It won't be easy. Reaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.Gas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. Reaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.Presenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:The government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.At the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements ""a massive let-down"".More than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.However, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. Russia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. Until recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.US President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. India - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. Some of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.But many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.For instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. But if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.There are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. However, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. And it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A458/production/_121127024_gettyimages-1327499341.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58874518,80,2021-11-04T15:31:33.000Z,science
20,Deforestation: Which countries are still cutting down trees?,"World leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.There have been other attempts to protect forests, but has any progress been made? Forests absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a major contributor to global warming - so cutting down trees can have a big impact on climate change.The UN says 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost since 1990. Agriculture is the main reason for this.There have been efforts to protect forests before.In 2014 the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030.Then, in 2017, it set another target to increase forested land by 3% worldwide by 2030.But deforestation continued at ""an alarming rate"", according to a 2019 report, with serious consequences for the fight against climate change.There has been some reforestation, through natural growth or planting, but trees need years to mature before they can fully absorb CO2. Over the past decade 4.7 million hectares of forest were still lost annually - with Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia among the countries worst affected.Some 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, and it plays a vital role in absorbing harmful CO2 that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.After falling steadily since 2004, deforestation in Brazil's Amazon has risen again, according to the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE). It said in 2020 that the deforestation rate was its highest in more than a decade.Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, told the UN that, as of August this year, deforestation in Brazil was down compared with 2020. However, the rate of deforestation is still higher than before he came to office in 2019.And Imazon - a research institute focused on the Amazon - says its data does not show the rate of deforestation slowing down this year.President Bolsonaro has been criticised for ""anti-environment"" policies, such as encouraging agriculture and mining in the Amazon.He has cut the funding for the government agencies that are responsible for prosecuting farmers and loggers who break environmental law. Fines for illegal logging fell by 20% in 2020.Exact figures are not available, but recent studies suggest as much as 94% of deforestation and habitat destruction in Brazil could be illegal.Brazil is not the only country responsible for the deforestation of the Amazon - neighbouring countries, including Bolivia, also contribute.Last year, Bolivia lost almost 300,000 hectares of tropical forest - the fourth-highest in the world.The Congo forest basin is the second-largest rainforest in the world. More than half of it lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo.Environmental campaign group Greenpeace says illegal logging - by both large and small companies - is leading to deforestation. Although the US and EU have banned importing illegal timber, it still gets smuggled outside the country.Other threats include small-scale subsistence agriculture, clearing for charcoal and fuel, urban expansion and mining.In the past five years, the annual loss of primary forest has been nearly half a million hectares, according to Global Forest Watch.President Felix Tshisekedi last month ordered an audit of some of the leases allocated to harvest public forests - including one for more than 1.4 million hectares - amid allegations of corruption. The move was welcomed by campaigners. But earlier this year, the government also announced a plan to lift a ban dating back to 2002 on new logging operations - although it has not yet been implemented.Greenpeace says that would contradict commitments made earlier this year to protect the forest and increase forest cover by 8%.Indonesia has been among the world's top five countries for forest loss for the past two decades.According to data from Global Forest Watch, the country lost 9.75 million hectares of primary forest between 2002 and 2020.President Joko Widodo pledged in 2014 to crack down on deforestation by tackling the main contributor - clearing land for oil palm plantations. Up to 80% of fires were set for this purpose, according to official data.In 2016, a record 929,000 hectares of forest disappeared, but there's been a steady decrease in the rate of deforestation since then.By 2020, the annual loss was down to 270,000 hectares.In 2019, President Widodo issued a three-year moratorium on new forest clearance, covering about 66 million hectares of primary forest and peatland. This was extended indefinitely this year.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12391/production/_121314647_gettyimages-1174358838.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/59136545,80,2021-11-02T19:25:52.000Z,science
21,What's the climate impact of private jets?,"There has been criticism of the number of world leaders and other delegates who have travelled to the COP26 summit in private jets.How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice?Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there.And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades.We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles, known as ""The Beast"", with him in Glasgow. He also had one in Rome on Sunday.FlightRadar24, which tracks flights, has looked at the number of non-commercial flights into Glasgow, Prestwick and Edinburgh airports since 27 October, excluding cargo, regular or local journeys.It has found that there were about 182 such flights, which is about double the total for the previous six days. That excludes some national chartered flights, such as President Biden's plane, Air Force One.Aviation analytics company Cirium told the BBC there was a total of 76 flights involving private jets, or VIP flights, arriving in and around Glasgow in the four days leading up to 1 November.Private jets have also been flying from Glasgow Airport, in Paisley, where they have dropped off passengers, to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, in Ayrshire, where they have been parking - a distance of about 41km.Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport.But this varies considerably depending on size, occupancy levels and efficiency. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights. There are many different models of private jet, but the Cessna Citation XLS - consistently one of the most popular - burns 189 gallons (857 litres) of aviation fuel an hour on average.If we were to consider the journey from Rome to Glasgow on a private jet - a journey that some of the G20 leaders made to get to COP 26 - that would take around two hours and 45 minutes, requiring 2,356 litres of jet fuel. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says 2.52kg of carbon dioxide is emitted for every litre of aviation turbine fuel burned. Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.However, BEIS recommends that to ""capture the maximum climate impact"" of flights, CO2 emissions figures should be multiplied by 1.9 to reflect the effect of non-CO2 emissions released by planes at high altitude, which, scientists say, increase the warming effect. Therefore, the total emissions for this flight would be 11.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and with a capacity of nine, each passenger would be responsible for 1.2 tonnes on their journey.If, however, our world leaders had decided to take a commercial flight from Rome to Glasgow their emissions would have been a quarter of a tonne each. Even though a commercial flight uses more fuel per hour, it is able to fly far more passengers than a private jet and therefore produces fewer emissions per person. ""A huge amount of fuel is used during takeoff and landing of a plane, no matter how many people you have on board. So an already polluting mode of transport (commercial aviation) becomes even worse (with private jets),"" said Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert in decarbonising transport at University of Oxford.In April, US President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit for world leaders, at which some commitments were made.But several have been talking at this summit about the value of meeting in person.The president of Sierra Leone said: ""I have travelled extensively because I have to be there - we're talking about challenges and the environment in Sierra Leone. If I don't come here, how will they know?""UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said face-to-face talks were needed for ""crunch negotiations"" such as this.Another question being asked on social media is why the meeting of the G20 that happened right before COP26 had to be in Rome.The G20 is a group of big economies plus the European Union. It has a summit once a year, hosted by whichever country is holding the rotating presidency of the group.If COP26 had been in November 2020, as originally planned, it would have been followed by the G20 summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Update 3 November: The piece has been amended to change US gallons to UK gallons in the example of the Cessna plane.Read more about the COP26 summit here.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

23,What is climate change? A really simple guide,"World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. However, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.If nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.Wildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image from Getty Images.

24,Climate change: How do we know it is happening and caused by humans?,"Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change. But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  The average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850. Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century. These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites. Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate.This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere.We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - has risen significantly since 1850.  Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm.Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past.Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic. That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities.There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, the tropics could have become ""dead zones"", too hot for most species to survive.These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Niño.For many years, groups of so-called climate ""sceptics"" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  A key UN report released in 2021 said it ""is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land"". The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image credit: Getty Images.

25,Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint?,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator. The Carbon Neutral Calculator is no longer online, but the methodology behind it can still be accessed.The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only ""blue water"", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.

26,Then and now: Why deforestation is such a hot topic,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. For decades, deforestation has been seen as a leading cause of environmental damage. Now, the full cost that losing our tree cover is having on the world's climate is being realised, and politicians are taking notice.If there was a poster-child of environmental degradation, surely it is deforestation. The removal of trees - for example, through logging or fires - has, for many decades, been listed as one of the main factors behind nature loss and environmental harm. In recent years, the loss of tree cover around the world has also been firmly linked to the increasingly volatile changes to the climate.Plants and trees absorb up to a third of our CO2 emissions from the atmosphere each year. Yet, as we fell vast swathes of primary forests around the globe, we are reducing our planet's ability to lock away, or sequester, the harmful gas that is released from burning fossil fuels.According to the UN, an estimated 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost through conversion to other land uses since 1990 - that is an area roughly equivalent to the size of Libya.However, campaigns to protect forests have had an impact during the past three decades. UN data suggests the rate of deforestation between 2015 and 2020 was an estimated 10 million hectares per year, down from 16 million hectares per year in the 1990s. While the issue of deforestation is taken very seriously at a global level, the implementation of strategies and policies to reduce deforestation ultimately rests with national governments.At this level, the track record is much more patchy. For example, Brazil - for a succession of governments - seemed to be heeding international advice and deforestation rates had been falling steadily since 2004.However, scientists writing in Nature journal last year listed the Brazilian Amazon deforestation rate for the previous 12 months as the highest in a decade.Campaigners said the deforestation rate had accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil's president in 2019. They said Mr Bolsonaro's policy of favouring agriculture and mining within the Amazon rainforest was to blame. It illustrates that international efforts to protect these valuable habitats are meaningless unless there is support from national governments.In recent years, trees have become a well-trodden solution for policymakers grappling with the threat posed by climate change.The ability of trees to sequester carbon is a very popular topic within the political arena. They are a well-known facet of the global carbon cycle, removing millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.Therefore, policies that promote and encourage the planting of hundreds of thousands of trees are billed as a vital part of the shift to sustainability, and a key part of the solutions-based approach to tackling the climate crisis facing the planet.However, there are a number of potential hurdles or limitations.Firstly, can we be sure that we are planting more trees than we are losing? Are the new saplings being offered enough protection to ensure they make it to being mature specimens? It is only once that a tree reaches maturity so that it can fully absorb CO2 - on average, about 21kg each year.What species are being planted to sequester carbon? Are they fast-growing or slow-growing? How long do they live? What happens when they die? Will the timber be used for materials and construction or will it be left to rot, releasing the carbon it had locked away from the atmosphere?It has also been identified in a number of studies in urban areas that tree planting schemes are struggling to keep up with the number of trees felled in the name of development.Secondly, as only mature trees can make a meaningful contribution to sequestering carbon, it will take many decades for a sapling to reach maturity. Therefore, the trees we are planting today will only be making a meaningful difference to the volume of CO2 in our atmosphere in half a century's time.A famous Chinese saying suggests that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.However, it adds, the second best time is today - so there is still hope.As another popular saying states: better late than never.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/ED5C/production/_115746706_optimised-amazongdp-nc.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58399809,80,2021-09-04T01:28:47.000Z,science
27,Then and now: Pandemic clears the air,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Air pollution has long been one of the biggest killers, claiming an estimated seven million victims annually. However, the Covid-19 global pandemic showed how quickly we could clear the air once we cut the number of journeys we made...Air pollution has long been one of the most severe forms of environmental damage.Figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that air pollution kills seven million people worldwide every year. Its data also shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits on high levels of pollutants.Law-change call after girl dies from air pollution How air pollution exacerbates Covid-19Lockdown prompts clear fall in UK air pollutionEmissions from fuel combustion account for almost a quarter of CO2 emissions from human activities.So the impact of lockdowns on transport around the globe in the Covid-19 pandemic has been stark.According to the International Energy Agency, average activity on the world's roads fell by almost 50% compared with 2019.The improvement in air quality was clear to see. In a short space of time, urban areas were recording massive reductions in a range of pollutants associated with internal combustion engines.Data collected by the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science shows marked reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and in particulate matter (PM2.5) across 10 cities.In India, people took to social media to post images of clear skies after an estimated 90% of road journeys stopped during the lockdown.Speaking in April, Sunil Dahiya from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air told BBC News: ""The current crisis has shown us that clear skies and breathable air can be achieved very fast if concrete action is taken to reduce burning of fossil fuels."" However, as quickly as air quality improved during lockdowns, so it appears to have returned to normal just as fast once lockdowns were eased or lifted.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the global response to the Covid-19 crisis has had little impact on the continued rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO2.Carbon emissions did fall dramatically as lockdowns cut transport and industry sharply.But data from the WMO showed that it had only marginally slowed the overall rise in concentrations.The details were published in the WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin.During the lockdowns, there were widespread calls for the environmental benefits to be maintained. Proponents said it was essential that economic growth after the pandemic focused on following a low emission, sustainable path.Despite calls to build back greener, it seems as if the priority has been business as usual, regardless of cost.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/30732/assets/app-project-assets/airqualityindia_smog_clear_after800.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57149747,80,2021-06-01T00:25:27.000Z,science
28,Then and now: A 'megadrought' in California,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of extreme weather on a crucial reservoir that supplies water to millions of people in northern California.This year is likely to be critically dry for California. Winter storms that dumped heavy snow and rain across the state are not expected to be substantial enough to counterbalance drought conditions.Lake Oroville plays a key role in California's complex water delivery system. This 65km-square body of water north of Sacramento is the second-largest reservoir in California.Not only does Lake Oroville store water, it helps control flooding elsewhere in the region, assists with the maintenance of water quality and boosts the health of fisheries downstream.In 2014, more than 80% of California was in the grip of an ""extreme drought"". Against this backdrop, Oroville's capacity fell to 30% - a historic low level.As the water level receded to hundreds of feet below normal levels, ramps and roads no longer reached the water's edge.More worryingly, the reservoir - when full - provided enough water for an estimated seven million households, as well as providing power for hydroelectricity facilities and irrigation for agricultural land.The dry conditions didn't start in 2014, however, there had been a drought for years prior to Oroville recording its historic low level.Indeed, the US space agency's Earth Observatory had warned that the multi-year drought was having a wider impact on the region. Among its effects was a contribution to ""unusually active and destructive"" fire seasons and poor yields from agricultural land.""There is strong evidence from climate models and centuries of tree ring data that suggest about one-third to one-half of the severity of the current drought can be attributed to climate change,"" observed Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist from Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.Agency scientists added that the data suggested a ""megadrought"" might already be underway in this region - and that it could last for decades. The latest update from the US Drought Monitor in December 2020, showed that much of the country's western states were gripped by extreme or exceptional drought, with Nevada, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, Colorado and western Texas being the worst affected.The Drought Monitor releases maps showing the parts of the country with prolonged shortages in the water supply. It is produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).Climate change is not just about a warmer world, it also means that the planet will see more extreme environmental conditions and weather. So, for example, episodes of flooding will increase, as well as episodes of droughts.Lake Oroville was a perfect illustration of how these extremes can threaten our existing infrastructure.While the lake's levels reached a historic low in 2014, the reservoir's vast embankment dam - the tallest in the US - was pushed to breaking point in February 2017.Following fierce storms in the surrounding mountains, water was flowing into the lake at a rate of roughly one-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools each second.Communities downstream had been evacuated, with more than 100,000 people being ordered to leave their homes.Officials were struggling to allow water to flow out of the lake because the main spillway - a structure that provides controlled releases of water - and the emergency spillway had been eroded and damaged. Yet they had to continue sending water down the valley because the reservoir was reaching capacity and there was a sense that there could be a ""catastrophic failure"" in the structure.In the space of two years, the lake went from an unprecedented low to a capacity that had not been experienced before. Water cascaded over the emergency spillways, which had not previously been required.Traditionally, the lake was replenished by meltwater from a thawing snowpack in surrounding mountains, whose river systems fed the reservoir. June was the month when the reservoir was expected to reach its yearly maximum level.However, in 2017, it was rain that caused the intense water flow. The reservoir had reached capacity in February, rather than the middle of the year, as usually happened.Scientists again suggested that the event fitted into the paradigm of a warming world.Speaking at the time to the Guardian newspaper, Prof Roger Bale, from the University of California Merced, explained: ""With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.""The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that the ""frequency and intensity of droughts, storms and extreme weather events are increasingly likely above 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels)"".Failure to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5C, as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is likely to result in more of the world's reservoirs or flood defences being tested to breaking point.This is a stark warning for world leaders, who will be gathering once again this year at the UN's annual climate summit (COP26) - to be held in Glasgow. The meeting, which had to be postponed by a year because of Covid, will seek to raise global ambition on tackling climate change - with a view to keeping temperature rise within the 1.5C limit.Our Planet Then and Now will continue up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is due to start in November 2021",https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/29194-slider-us-drought/assets/app-project-assets/img/bidwell_2014_v2.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56225862,80,2021-03-04T01:16:52.000Z,science
29,Then and now: When silence descended over Victoria Falls,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of global heating on Victoria Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world - and how Sub-Saharan Africa is learning to cope with the climate crisis.In full flow, Victoria Falls easily qualifies as one of the natural wonders of the world. Spanning 1.7km at its widest point and with a height of more than 100m, locals refer to Africa's greatest waterfall as ""the smoke that thunders"".This amazing feature is formed as the Zambezi river plunges into a chasm called the First Gorge. The chasm was carved by the action of water along a natural fracture zone in the volcanic rock that makes up the landscape in this region of southern Africa.In 2019, however, Victoria Falls was silenced.In a drought described as the worst in a century, the flow of the Zambezi was reduced to a relative trickle and the Falls ran dry.As one of the region's biggest attractions for tourists, Victoria Falls is a valuable source of income for Zimbabwe and Zambia. As news of the low waters spread, local traders noticed a visible drop in tourist numbers.As well as hitting the countries' economies, it also hit electricity supplies, which are dependent on hydroelectric generation.More widely across the region, agencies reported an increase in the need for food aid, as crops failed in the drought.A single extreme weather event cannot, in isolation, be viewed as a consequence of climate change. But the region is recording a sequence of extreme droughts that reflect what climate modellers have predicted will occur as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere as a result of human activity.Zambia's President, Edgar Lungu - speaking at the time - called it ""a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment"".Observers of weather patterns in the Zambezi Basin believe the changing climate is resulting in a delay to the monsoon season, concentrating the rains into bigger, more intense events. This makes the storage of the water in the region more difficult, and makes the impact of the extended dry season more damaging to people and the environment.The UN's State of the Climate in Africa in 2019 report painted a worrying picture for a continent that could see its population double over the coming century.Speaking at the report's launch in October 2020, World Meteorological Organization secretary-general Petteri Taalas observed: ""Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent, hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources.""In recent months, we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert locusts and now face the looming spectre of drought because of a La Niña event.""The report adds that 2019 was among the three warmest years on record for the continent. It warns that the warming trend is expected to continue. The worrying fact facing politicians, policymakers and civil society is that the continent is set to be hardest hit by climate change, yet the continent's capacity to adapt to the realities of a warming world are low.Areas of concern include water supplies, health, food security, droughts and floods, biodiversity. It is a list of concerns that is continuing to grow.Africa is on the front line of the battle against dangerous climate change.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/newsspec/30118/assets/app-project-assets/image_slider_victoria_falls_after.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56902340,80,2021-05-01T23:10:52.000Z,science
30,Then and now: Arctic sea-ice feeling the heat,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. The shrinking sea-ice in the Arctic is not only a sign of climate change, it is causing the planet to warm more quickly. This is because more sunlight is being absorbed by the darker ocean, rather than being reflected back into space.Arctic sea-ice plays an important role in controlling the planet's temperature, and any problem with this natural thermostat is a cause for concern.Figures from the US space agency (Nasa) suggest the loss of the minimum Arctic sea-ice extent is in the region of 13.1% per decade, based on the 1981 to 2010 average.A major report on climate change in 2007 linked the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused by human activity, with declining sea-ice extent in the region.The disappearance of the sea-ice in a warming world also contributes to rising average surface temperatures. The sea-ice is estimated to reflect 80% of sunlight back into space, meaning it does not warm the surface. But when the sea-ice has melted, the darker ocean surface is exposed, which absorbs about 90% of the sunlight hitting it. This results in warming of the region.This phenomenon is known as the Albedo effect, and it occurs because light surfaces reflect more heat than dark surfaces.The freezing and thawing of the ocean in the Arctic is a seasonal occurrence, with the freezing peaking in March and the melting reaching its maximum in September. However, data from on-the-ground observations and from satellites tell us that the extent of sea-ice in the Arctic polar region is declining as the planet warms.As this occurs, the albedo (or reflectivity) is reduced, because the dark ocean waters absorb more heat than the lighter sea-ice. This in turn causes the land and oceans to warm even more. Ultimately, scientists fear, the increasing amount of ground being exposed in regions traditionally covered with snow will trigger a ""tipping point"". This is where the warming of the atmosphere reaches a point where human interventions will no longer be able to halt it.Another impact of the decreasing density of ice in the northern polar region is the opening of the Northwest Passage. This trading route links the North Atlantic Ocean with the North Pacific Ocean.Since the 19th Century, there has been clamour to find a navigable route through frozen Arctic waters between Greenland and Canada's Arctic islands.It has long been a deadly pursuit for mariners who braved the frozen seascape. However, some experts estimate that the route will become commercially viable in the near future as the sea-ice retreats in the summer months.For some, it is going to revolutionise the global shipping sector. For others, it is a disaster waiting to happen.Environmental groups fear a growing volume of shipping traffic through the pristine Arctic waters will damage slow-growing, long-lived marine ecosystems.They particularly fear a ship encountering a mishap in the remote polar waters, resulting in a potentially devastating pollution incident.Evidence suggests that the thinning sea-ice is affecting wildlife, including top-of-the-food-chain predators such as polar bears. The ice is not strong enough to support the animals' weight, forcing them to embark on energy-sapping swims and making it more difficult to catch prey. As well as causing starvation, it is also reportedly resulting in bears coming into human settlements looking for food.Another concern among scientists is that melting sea-ice is affecting a major ocean current in the Arctic - the Beaufort Gyre. Freshwater is less dense than salty seawater. The researchers said a sudden influx of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean into the northern Atlantic Ocean could alter the strength of the current. This is because the force pushing water down the eastern coast of continental North America will be reduced, resulting in a smaller volume of warmer tropic waters from equatorial regions being displaced towards western Europe. Models suggest the reduction in warmer waters heading towards western Europe will result in lower temperatures in the region. This, in turn, would also affect weather patterns in the global climate system.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10CF/production/_119130340_leads_seaice_small.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57650226,80,2021-07-02T23:02:43.000Z,science
31,Belarus migrants: Poland PM blames Russia's Putin for migrant crisis,"Poland's Prime Minister has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind a migrant crisis at Belarus's border with Poland.Mateusz Morawiecki said that Belarus's authoritarian leader, a close ally of Mr Putin, is orchestrating the crisis, but ""it has its mastermind in Moscow"".At least 2,000 migrants are stuck at the border in freezing conditions.Belarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko denies claims it is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions.Video footage shows crowds of people on the Belarusian side of a barbed-wire border fence with Poland. Some try to force their way through using bolt cutters, tree trunks and group force, while Polish guards fend them off with what appears to be tear gas.Many of the migrants are young men but there are also women and children, mostly from the Middle East and Asia. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other, unable to enter Poland or retreat back into Belarus.Overnight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several people have already died in recent weeks. Speaking on Tuesday at an emergency parliamentary session after visiting troops on the border, Mr Morawiecki said: ""This attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow, the mastermind is President Putin.""He accused the Russian and Belarusian leaders of trying to destabilise the European Union - which the two countries are not part of - by allowing migrants to travel through Belarus and enter the bloc.Mr Morawiecki described the situation as ""a new type of war in which people are used as human shields"", and said Poland was dealing with a ""stage play"" which is designed to create chaos in the EU. He added that it was the first time in 30 years that Poland's border security had been so ""brutally attacked"". Poland has deployed extra troops to the border, and warned of a possible ""armed"" escalation, fearing that Belarus might try to provoke an incident.Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all part of the EU, have seen a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. On Tuesday, Lithuania declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus, which will come into effect at midnight.Poland has seen the most arrivals, especially around its major border crossing at Kuznica.Poland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. Journalists and aid agencies have been banned from accessing the area.""Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,"" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd from Iraq told the BBC by video-call.He described how he had arrived in Belarus's capital, Minsk, from Baghdad at the start of November, and was now in a make-shift camp metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.""There's no way to escape,"" he said. ""Poland won't let us in. Every night they fly helicopters. They don't let us sleep. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.""The EU, Nato and the US all accuse Belarus of coordinating the surge of migrants. The European Commission has accused Mr Lukashenko of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an ""inhuman, gangster-style approach"".Brussels says his actions are a retaliation against EU sanctions, which were imposed after his widely discredited re-election and subsequent crackdown on mass protests.Activists say the migrants are being used as pawns in a political game between Belarus and its EU neighbours. Lithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants. Its government said declaring a state of emergency was a precautionary response.About two dozen migrants who were detained in Lithuania after illegally crossing over from Belarus were suspected of having links to terrorist organisations, Lithuania's vice interior minister Kestutis Lancinskas told the BBC.Most of them presented fake IDs when they were stopped and background checks are still ongoing, Mr Lancinskas said. He could not comment on which terrorist organisations may have links with the migrants, nor when they were detained.""There is always a certain level of risk when there's a large number of people crossing the border,"" Mr Lancinskas said.""All member states have a level of terrorism threat.

33,Ghislaine Maxwell to challenge accusers' memories,"Ghislaine Maxwell will challenge claims that she groomed underage girls for the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.According to a letter by her lawyer, the British socialite's defence will say her accusers might have faulty memories.The letter says that leading experts in psychiatry and memory would be brought in to testify in her defence.Ms Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her.She has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July last year, awaiting the trial which will begin on 29 November and last six weeks.The letter, written by Ms Maxwell's lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca, gives a first glimpse at what her legal team are hoping to use to defend her in court.Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist specialising in false memory, is one of the experts they are hoping to call. She has testified in more than 300 trials, including those for high-profile defendants such as Harvey Weinstein, Ted Bundy and OJ Simpson.

34,Nagaenthran: Family prays for miracle to halt execution of man with low IQ,"Sarmila Dharmalingam is praying for a miracle. Her brother, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, is set to be hanged in Singapore's Changi Prison. ""When I'm alone and I think of my brother, there is pain. But [we need to] be brave and keep on praying - anything can happen,"" she told the BBC.In 2009, then 21-year-old Nagaenthran was caught trying to smuggle heroin into Singapore from Malaysia. Nagaenthran was initially due to be hanged on Wednesday morning, but was granted a last-minute stay of execution. On Tuesday he was found to have Covid-19 and the execution was further delayed.The Malaysian citizen was sentenced to death despite an assessment by a medical expert that he has an IQ of 69 - a level recognised as indicating an intellectual disability. But the Singapore government said he ""clearly understood the nature of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing"". Singapore has one of the world's toughest drug laws and locally, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial. But this case appears to have sparked a rare disquiet in the island nation.More than 60,000 people have now signed a petition calling for Singapore's president to pardon Nagaenthran, citing the fact that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law.  ""It is completely disheartening that an intellectually disabled man is being punished for a non-violent crime,"" said one person who signed the petition. ""Neither he nor his family deserve this pain. Please save him.""The movement has also gained traction on social media, where there is an unusual outpouring of anger and sympathy. Sarmila says she's not clear if the 33-year-old himself understands how dire his situation is. ""Sometimes he calls me and tells me he is going to be hanged and that he needs to get ready,"" she told the BBC.""[Other times] he says he wants to come back home to eat home-cooked food. I don't know whether or not he knows [what's about to happen].""If he is hanged it will be the first execution Singapore has carried out since 2019. In 2009, Nagaenthran was caught crossing into Singapore from Malaysia with 43g (1.5oz) heroin strapped on to his left thigh. Under Singapore's laws, those caught carrying more than 15g of heroin will be subject to the death penalty. During his trial, he initially said he was coerced into carrying the drugs, but later said he had committed the offence because he needed money. The court said his initial defence was ""fabricated"". He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging. In 2015, he appealed to have his sentence commuted to life in prison on the basis that he suffered from an intellectual disability. In 2017 one psychiatrist, Dr Ken Ung, said that Nagaenthran suffered from a mild intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a drinking disorder - all of which would have ""significantly affected his judgement [and] decision making"". In cross examination, Dr Ung appeared to contradict himself and said Nagaenthran could instead be suffering from borderline intellectual functioning.While three other psychiatrists told the court that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled, one found that his ""borderline intelligence may have contributed towards his... agreeing to carry out the offence"". In the end, the court found that he was not intellectually disabled. A final push for presidential clemency was also rejected last year.

35,World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - report,"Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.COP26 ""has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.COP26 is expected to finish this week.The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. So how has the confusion come about?The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13965/production/_121492208_untitled6.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59220687,80,2021-11-09T14:01:50.000Z,politics
36,Metallurgist admits faking steel test results for US Navy subs,"A metallurgist in the US state of Washington has pleaded guilty to fraud after she spent decades faking the results of strength tests on steel that was being used to make Navy submarines.Prosecutors say Elaine Marie Thomas, 67, gave false positive readings for strength and toughness tests in at least 240 cases between 1985 and 2017.Authorities did not disclose which vessels were affected.But there was no indication that any submarine hulls had failed.Ms Thomas, of Auburn, Washington, was the director of metallurgy at a foundry in Tacoma that supplied steel castings used by Navy contractors to make submarine hulls, the US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington said in a statement.The foundry was acquired by the manufacturer Bradken in 2008, according to the indictment. There was no evidence that the company's management was aware of the fraud until May 2017. At that time, prosecutors say, a lab employee found out that test cards had been altered and that other discrepancies existed in the records.Prosecutors said the falsified tests ""represent[ed] a substantial percentage of the castings Bradken produced for the Navy"". In 2020, Bradken agreed to pay $10.9m (£8m) as part of a settlement.The Navy has taken measures to ensure the safe operation of the affected submarines, resulting in increased costs, according to the statement.When confronted with the falsified results, Ms Thomas suggested that in some cases she gave metal positive results because she thought it was ""stupid"" that the Navy required the tests to be conducted at -100F (-70C), the Associated Press reports.John Carpenter, a lawyer for Ms Thomas, said in a statement filed in federal court on Monday that she ""took shortcuts and made material misrepresentations.""""Ms Thomas never intended to compromise the integrity of any material and is gratified that the government's testing does not suggest that the structural integrity of any submarine was in fact compromised,"" he said. ""This offense is unique in that it was neither motivated by greed nor any desire for personal enrichment. She regrets that she failed to follow her moral compass - admitting to false statements is hardly how she envisioned living out her retirement years.""Ms Thomas faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1m fine. She will be sentenced in February.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6E12/production/_121487182_gettyimages-523821864.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59186655,80,2021-11-09T08:54:06.000Z,politics
37,Regular 10pm bedtime linked to lower heart risk,"There appears to be an optimal bedtime - between 10pm and 11pm - linked to better heart health, say researchers who have studied 88,000 volunteers.The team behind the UK Biobank work believe synchronising sleep to match our internal body clock may explain the association found with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes.  The body's natural 24-hour rhythm is important for wellbeing and alertness.It can also impact things like blood pressure.For the study, which was published in the European Heart Journal, the researchers collected data on sleep and wake times over seven days using a wristwatch-like device worn by the volunteers. And they followed up what happened to the volunteers in terms of heart and circulatory health over an average of six years. Just over 3,000 of the adults developed cardiovascular disease. Many of these cases occurred in people who went to bed later or earlier than the ""ideal"" 10pm to 11pm.The link persisted after adjustments were made for sleep duration and sleep irregularity.The researchers tried to look at other factors known to affect a person's heart risk, such as their age, weight and cholesterol levels, but stress their study cannot prove cause and effect. Study author Dr David Plans, working with the healthtech organisation Huma, said: ""While we cannot conclude causation from our study, the results suggest that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with adverse consequences for cardiovascular health.""The riskiest time was after midnight, potentially because it may reduce the likelihood of seeing morning light, which resets the body clock.""Regina Giblin, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This large study suggests that going to sleep between 10 and 11pm could be the sweet spot for most people to keep their heart healthy long-term. ""However, it's important to remember that this study can only show an association and can't prove cause and effect. More research is needed into sleep timing and duration as a risk factor for heart and circulatory diseases. Getting enough sleep is important for our general wellbeing as well as our heart and circulatory health, and most adults should aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night, she said.""But sleep isn't the only factor that can impact heart health. It's also important to look at your lifestyle as knowing your numbers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly, cutting down on salt and alcohol intake, and eating a balanced diet can also help to keep your heart healthy.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/916C/production/_121482273_gettyimages-656470551.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-59204831,80,2021-11-09T00:43:27.000Z,politics
38,Belarus migrants: Poland PM blames Russia's Putin for migrant crisis,"Poland's Prime Minister has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind a migrant crisis at Belarus's border with Poland.Mateusz Morawiecki said that Belarus's authoritarian leader, a close ally of Mr Putin, is orchestrating the crisis, but ""it has its mastermind in Moscow"".At least 2,000 migrants are stuck at the border in freezing conditions.Belarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko denies claims it is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions.Video footage shows crowds of people on the Belarusian side of a barbed-wire border fence with Poland. Some try to force their way through using bolt cutters, tree trunks and group force, while Polish guards fend them off with what appears to be tear gas.Many of the migrants are young men but there are also women and children, mostly from the Middle East and Asia. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other, unable to enter Poland or retreat back into Belarus.Overnight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several people have already died in recent weeks. Speaking on Tuesday at an emergency parliamentary session after visiting troops on the border, Mr Morawiecki said: ""This attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow, the mastermind is President Putin.""He accused the Russian and Belarusian leaders of trying to destabilise the European Union - which the two countries are not part of - by allowing migrants to travel through Belarus and enter the bloc.Mr Morawiecki described the situation as ""a new type of war in which people are used as human shields"", and said Poland was dealing with a ""stage play"" which is designed to create chaos in the EU. He added that it was the first time in 30 years that Poland's border security had been so ""brutally attacked"". Poland has deployed extra troops to the border, and warned of a possible ""armed"" escalation, fearing that Belarus might try to provoke an incident.Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all part of the EU, have seen a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. On Tuesday, Lithuania declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus, which will come into effect at midnight.Poland has seen the most arrivals, especially around its major border crossing at Kuznica.Poland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. Journalists and aid agencies have been banned from accessing the area.""Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,"" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd from Iraq told the BBC by video-call.He described how he had arrived in Belarus's capital, Minsk, from Baghdad at the start of November, and was now in a make-shift camp metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.""There's no way to escape,"" he said. ""Poland won't let us in. Every night they fly helicopters. They don't let us sleep. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.""The EU, Nato and the US all accuse Belarus of coordinating the surge of migrants. The European Commission has accused Mr Lukashenko of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an ""inhuman, gangster-style approach"".Brussels says his actions are a retaliation against EU sanctions, which were imposed after his widely discredited re-election and subsequent crackdown on mass protests.Activists say the migrants are being used as pawns in a political game between Belarus and its EU neighbours. Lithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants. Its government said declaring a state of emergency was a precautionary response.About two dozen migrants who were detained in Lithuania after illegally crossing over from Belarus were suspected of having links to terrorist organisations, Lithuania's vice interior minister Kestutis Lancinskas told the BBC.Most of them presented fake IDs when they were stopped and background checks are still ongoing, Mr Lancinskas said. He could not comment on which terrorist organisations may have links with the migrants, nor when they were detained.""There is always a certain level of risk when there's a large number of people crossing the border,"" Mr Lancinskas said.""All member states have a level of terrorism threat. Our intelligence services are doing their best to prevent those kinds of activities.""In an interview with the Belarusian state news agency, Mr Lukashenko said he wanted to avoid any military escalation on the border which could draw Russia into a conflict.He said he was ""not a madman"" and knew what was at stake, but remained defiant, saying ""we will not kneel down"".The Belarus defence ministry has accused Warsaw of violating agreements by moving thousands of troops to the border. Belarus insists migrants are arriving there legally and that it is merely acting ""as a hospitable country"".Russia has praised its ally's ""responsible"" handling of the border row and said it is watching the situation closely.Are you in the area?

It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. So how has the confusion come about?The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13965/production/_121492208_untitled6.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59220687,80,2021-11-09T14:01:50.000Z,politics
42,Metallurgist admits faking steel test results for US Navy subs,"A metallurgist in the US state of Washington has pleaded guilty to fraud after she spent decades faking the results of strength tests on steel that was being used to make Navy submarines.Prosecutors say Elaine Marie Thomas, 67, gave false positive readings for strength and toughness tests in at least 240 cases between 1985 and 2017.Authorities did not disclose which vessels were affected.But there was no indication that any submarine hulls had failed.Ms Thomas, of Auburn, Washington, was the director of metallurgy at a foundry in Tacoma that supplied steel castings used by Navy contractors to make submarine hulls, the US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington said in a statement.The foundry was acquired by the manufacturer Bradken in 2008, according to the indictment. There was no evidence that the company's management was aware of the fraud until May 2017. At that time, prosecutors say, a lab employee found out that test cards had been altered and that other discrepancies existed in the records.Prosecutors said the falsified tests ""represent[ed] a substantial percentage of the castings Bradken produced for the Navy"". In 2020, Bradken agreed to pay $10.9m (£8m) as part of a settlement.The Navy has taken measures to ensure the safe operation of the affected submarines, resulting in increased costs, according to the statement.When confronted with the falsified results, Ms Thomas suggested that in some cases she gave metal positive results because she thought it was ""stupid"" that the Navy required the tests to be conducted at -100F (-70C), the Associated Press reports.John Carpenter, a lawyer for Ms Thomas, said in a statement filed in federal court on Monday that she ""took shortcuts and made material misrepresentations.""""Ms Thomas never intended to compromise the integrity of any material and is gratified that the government's testing does not suggest that the structural integrity of any submarine was in fact compromised,"" he said. ""This offense is unique in that it was neither motivated by greed nor any desire for personal enrichment. She regrets that she failed to follow her moral compass - admitting to false statements is hardly how she envisioned living out her retirement years.""Ms Thomas faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1m fine.

43,Regular 10pm bedtime linked to lower heart risk,"There appears to be an optimal bedtime - between 10pm and 11pm - linked to better heart health, say researchers who have studied 88,000 volunteers.The team behind the UK Biobank work believe synchronising sleep to match our internal body clock may explain the association found with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes.  The body's natural 24-hour rhythm is important for wellbeing and alertness.It can also impact things like blood pressure.For the study, which was published in the European Heart Journal, the researchers collected data on sleep and wake times over seven days using a wristwatch-like device worn by the volunteers. And they followed up what happened to the volunteers in terms of heart and circulatory health over an average of six years. Just over 3,000 of the adults developed cardiovascular disease. Many of these cases occurred in people who went to bed later or earlier than the ""ideal"" 10pm to 11pm.The link persisted after adjustments were made for sleep duration and sleep irregularity.The researchers tried to look at other factors known to affect a person's heart risk, such as their age, weight and cholesterol levels, but stress their study cannot prove cause and effect. Study author Dr David Plans, working with the healthtech organisation Huma, said: ""While we cannot conclude causation from our study, the results suggest that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with adverse consequences for cardiovascular health.""The riskiest time was after midnight, potentially because it may reduce the likelihood of seeing morning light, which resets the body clock.""Regina Giblin, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This large study suggests that going to sleep between 10 and 11pm could be the sweet spot for most people to keep their heart healthy long-term. ""However, it's important to remember that this study can only show an association and can't prove cause and effect. More research is needed into sleep timing and duration as a risk factor for heart and circulatory diseases. Getting enough sleep is important for our general wellbeing as well as our heart and circulatory health, and most adults should aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night, she said.""But sleep isn't the only factor that can impact heart health. It's also important to look at your lifestyle as knowing your numbers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly, cutting down on salt and alcohol intake, and eating a balanced diet can also help to keep your heart healthy.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/916C/production/_121482273_gettyimages-656470551.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-59204831,80,2021-11-09T00:43:27.000Z,politics
44,Ghislaine Maxwell to challenge accusers' memories,"Ghislaine Maxwell will challenge claims that she groomed underage girls for the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.According to a letter by her lawyer, the British socialite's defence will say her accusers might have faulty memories.The letter says that leading experts in psychiatry and memory would be brought in to testify in her defence.Ms Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her.She has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July last year, awaiting the trial which will begin on 29 November and last six weeks.The letter, written by Ms Maxwell's lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca, gives a first glimpse at what her legal team are hoping to use to defend her in court.Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist specialising in false memory, is one of the experts they are hoping to call. She has testified in more than 300 trials, including those for high-profile defendants such as Harvey Weinstein, Ted Bundy and OJ Simpson. According to her profile on the UCI School of Social Ecology, Ms Loftus' research has revealed how memories can be changed by things we are told and information we subtly absorb after an event.""She will describe scientific research showing that false memories can be described with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories,"" the letter reads.Another expert the defence wants to use is leading forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, who has 40 years experience and has been part of more than 1,000 evaluations of allegations of sexual abuse, according to the letter.Mr Dietz would testify that building the trust of the accusers did not automatically imply they would be abused.He would also argue that there is no consistent definition for the term ""grooming"", and therefore no empirical evidence that Ms Maxwell committed ""grooming-by-proxy"" by allegedly arranging sexualized massages for Epstein.Mr Dietz would testify that Epstein, ""like many people who achieve great power and wealth"" created and exploited a ""halo effect to surround himself with people who would serve his needs"". A hearing on admitting expert testimony is scheduled for Wednesday.Ms Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, has been accused of helping to recruit and groom four underage girls for Epstein to abuse from 1994 to 2004, and also charged with sex trafficking. Epstein killed himself in a New York prison cell on 10 August as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10579/production/_118173966_7adaade1-04df-4abf-8cc8-44eafe7dd10f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59210403,80,2021-11-08T23:55:49.000Z,politics
45,Nagaenthran: Family prays for miracle to halt execution of man with low IQ,"Sarmila Dharmalingam is praying for a miracle. Her brother, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, is set to be hanged in Singapore's Changi Prison. ""When I'm alone and I think of my brother, there is pain. But [we need to] be brave and keep on praying - anything can happen,"" she told the BBC.In 2009, then 21-year-old Nagaenthran was caught trying to smuggle heroin into Singapore from Malaysia. Nagaenthran was initially due to be hanged on Wednesday morning, but was granted a last-minute stay of execution. On Tuesday he was found to have Covid-19 and the execution was further delayed.The Malaysian citizen was sentenced to death despite an assessment by a medical expert that he has an IQ of 69 - a level recognised as indicating an intellectual disability. But the Singapore government said he ""clearly understood the nature of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing"". Singapore has one of the world's toughest drug laws and locally, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial. But this case appears to have sparked a rare disquiet in the island nation.More than 60,000 people have now signed a petition calling for Singapore's president to pardon Nagaenthran, citing the fact that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law.  ""It is completely disheartening that an intellectually disabled man is being punished for a non-violent crime,"" said one person who signed the petition. ""Neither he nor his family deserve this pain. Please save him.""The movement has also gained traction on social media, where there is an unusual outpouring of anger and sympathy. Sarmila says she's not clear if the 33-year-old himself understands how dire his situation is. ""Sometimes he calls me and tells me he is going to be hanged and that he needs to get ready,"" she told the BBC.""[Other times] he says he wants to come back home to eat home-cooked food. I don't know whether or not he knows [what's about to happen].""If he is hanged it will be the first execution Singapore has carried out since 2019. In 2009, Nagaenthran was caught crossing into Singapore from Malaysia with 43g (1.5oz) heroin strapped on to his left thigh. Under Singapore's laws, those caught carrying more than 15g of heroin will be subject to the death penalty. During his trial, he initially said he was coerced into carrying the drugs, but later said he had committed the offence because he needed money. The court said his initial defence was ""fabricated"". He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging. In 2015, he appealed to have his sentence commuted to life in prison on the basis that he suffered from an intellectual disability. In 2017 one psychiatrist, Dr Ken Ung, said that Nagaenthran suffered from a mild intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a drinking disorder - all of which would have ""significantly affected his judgement [and] decision making"". In cross examination, Dr Ung appeared to contradict himself and said Nagaenthran could instead be suffering from borderline intellectual functioning.While three other psychiatrists told the court that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled, one found that his ""borderline intelligence may have contributed towards his... agreeing to carry out the offence"". In the end, the court found that he was not intellectually disabled. A final push for presidential clemency was also rejected last year. ""The Court of Appeal found that this was the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question,"" said Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs in a statement. Global rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned the verdict.""Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International's Singapore Researcher.The case has also caused outrage in Nagaenthran's home country Malaysia where protests have been held calling for the execution to be halted.Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has also personally appealed to his Singaporean counterpart.After 10 years on death row, Sarmila received a letter sent by the Singapore Prison Service saying Nagaenthran's execution had been set for 10 November.""I couldn't accept it... I was crying. I cried the whole day. I was so afraid to tell my mother because she suffers from [some] health conditions. I couldn't look her in the face.""The family was given around two weeks to arrange travel, hotel quarantine and the Covid tests they would need to enter Singapore. Activists have highlighted the additional challenges of travelling during a pandemic. ""[The family has to] make health declarations, get travel insurance, find their own accommodation [among others]... [and they] are expected to foot the bill for all this,"" activist Kirsten Han, who started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the family told the BBC. ""It's a tremendous amount of money for a Malaysian family, and there are still [other] expenses to consider, as well as potential funeral costs."" Some $17,000 ($12,600; £9,300) was eventually raised through the crowdfunding campaign. Sarmila says her family would not have been able to make their way to Singapore without it.The family arrived in Singapore last week. Sarmila did not come to Singapore with the rest of the family, as she says someone needs to manage matters at home. Unable to see her brother before his planned execution, she says she is praying everyday.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DAE5/production/_121473065_089dc074-3ba2-457f-9d4c-7cf764f4a5be.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59172767,80,2021-11-09T07:14:15.000Z,politics

49,California couple sue clinic for alleged IVF swap 'horror',"A California couple gave birth to a stranger's child after being given the wrong embryo by a fertility clinic during in vitro fertilisation (IVF), says a lawsuit.Daphna and Alexander Cardinale say they gave birth in September 2019 to a girl that looked nothing like them.After a DNA test, they found the couple that carried their daughter to term, and together decided to swap the girls. This is not the first alleged mix-up during an IVF procedure.IVF is a procedure during which a woman's eggs are fertilised by man's sperm in a laboratory before the embryos are implanted into a woman's uterus.The Cardinales are suing the Los Angeles-based fertility centre, the California Center for Reproductive Health (CCRH), as well as In VitroTech Labs, an embryology lab.The lawsuit alleges medical malpractice, negligence and fraudulent concealment. Neither company responded to a BBC News request for comment. In an emotional news conference on Monday, Mrs Cardinale said her family's ""heartbreak and confusion can't be understated"".""Our memories of childbirth will always be tainted by the sick reality that our biological child was given to someone else, and the baby that I fought to bring into this world was not mine to keep.""Mrs Cardinale said she was ""robbed of the ability to carry my own child"".According to the lawsuit, the couple sought help from the fertility clinic in the summer of 2018. Mrs Cardinale gave birth the next year to a child they thought was theirs. In the delivery room, Mr Cardinale had expected ""a fair child"", like their firstborn, but he was surprised to see the baby girl ""came out with much darker skin"", says the lawsuit.""It was so jarring that Alexander actually took several steps away from the birthing table, backing up against the wall,"" reads the legal action.Nearly two months later the family decided to take at-home DNA tests, which ultimately determined they were not biologically related to the infant. ""The room shrank and got really dizzy and everything just went numb,"" Mr Cardinale said, recalling the moment the DNA results came back.  The CCRH then helped them find the California couple who had carried their daughter and had given birth to another healthy girl a week apart. The Cardinales' daughter was around four months old when they first met. After several meetings, the couples agreed to go through the legal process of formally exchanging the babies, which happened in January 2020.""Instead of breastfeeding my own child, I breastfed and bonded with a child I was later forced to give away,"" Mrs Cardinale said at the news conference.She added that the incident has been hardest for the couple's seven-year-old daughter, who has struggled to understand the swap. ""The horror of this situation cannot be understated,"" says the lawsuit.Mrs Cardinale, a licensed therapist, and her husband, a singer-songwriter, have since both sought mental-health treatment for ""symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD"", says the legal action.Adam B Wolf, a lawyer representing the Cardinales, said the other family in the mix-up also plans to sue, but will remain anonymous.

50,Tiger King 2: Carole Baskin has 'no claim' to sue over footage - Netflix,"Netflix has said Carole Baskin has ""no claim"" in suing the company over the use of footage of her in Tiger King 2.Baskin and her husband Howard launched legal action against Netflix last week for breach of contract after they appeared in the show's trailer.Their lawsuit stated they only signed appearance release forms for the first season of the Netflix docu-series.Netflix now says they signed releases in 2019 that ""explicitly permit"" the footage use in later projects.The streamer and Royal Goode Productions, who are also included in the Baskins' legal claim, have called for it to be denied.Their case filing says Carole Baskin became a ""pop culture phenomenon"" as a result of Tiger King, adding she had ""no claim at all"" and her ""breach of contract claim is merely a red herring, lacking any merit"".Tiger King followed the rivalry between eccentric Oklahoma zoo owner Joe Exotic and animal rights activist Baskin.The show became a cultural phenomenon in March 2020, fuelled partly by the pandemic-enforced lockdowns.Carole Baskin, the owner and CEO of the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, has said she was unhappy with how she had been presented and described the series as ""a reality show dumpster fire"".The Baskins want Royal Goode Productions and Netflix to drop all footage of them from Tiger King 2 and are seeking to take the case in front of a jury.The lawsuit states: ""By utilising the film footage of the Baskins and Big Cat Rescue secured by Royal Goode Productions under the Appearance Releases in 'sizzle reels' and promotional trailers for the sequel entitled Tiger King 2, the defendants are in breach of the terms of the Appearance Releases.""The lawsuit also claims the first series gave a false impression of the work of Big Cat Rescue and unfairly accused the Baskins of animal abuse.""The Tiger King 1 series wrongly attempted to suggest that Big Cat Rescue abused its animals by keeping them in very small cages while not making clear that the animals actually reside in expansive enclosures,"" the legal papers state.""Perhaps most pernicious is the overarching implication in Tiger King 1 that Carole Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her first husband in 1997,"" the papers say. Carole Baskin has repeatedly denied that she had anything to do with the disappearance of her first husband Don Lewis.Netflix and Royal Goode Productions have called for the case to be denied as it ""strikes at the heart of the First Amendment"" of the US Constitution protecting free speech.An evidentiary hearing in the case is ""futile"" due to the ""insurmountable constitutional hurdle"", the streamer said.Last week a Florida judge had already denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that would block footage of the Baskins in the second season of Tiger King.The judge ruled that the Baskins ""are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order, which would be entered before Defendants have had an adequate opportunity to respond"".Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, And Madness told the story of Baskin's nemesis, the flamboyant big cat enthusiast Joe Exotic.Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was the owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, which he has now sold.In 2018, Exotic was arrested and accused of hiring two men to murder Baskin.The following year he was found guilty of multiple federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 22 years in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.An appeals court has since ruled Exotic should receive a shorter sentence after he said he'd been diagnosed with ""aggressive"" prostate cancer.The second season of Tiger King will stream on Netflix from 17 November.

51,Peruvian family dog turns out to be Andean fox,"A family in Peru who thought they had bought a dog soon realised they had an Andean fox on their hands after it attacked other animals in their area.The Sotelos bought the puppy for $13 (£9.50) from a small shop in the capital, Lima, believing it was a purebred husky.But after a while, they received complaints from neighbours about their so-called dog named Run Run.The canine impostor has since been caught by wildlife officials.It became clear there was a case of mistaken identity when Run Run began to chase guinea pigs, chickens and ducks to kill or eat them, provoking the anger of neighbours. ""About a month ago, a woman from around here said that it ate three of her guinea pigs. And then two or three days ago, a local grandmother came and said that it killed guinea pigs,"" owner Maribel Sotelo told Reuters news agency.Run Run turned out to be an Andean fox, which has thin legs, a bushy tail, a pointed head and prominent ears, but it is more closely related to wolves and jackals than foxes.The National Forest and Wildlife Service in Peru says wild animals are often bought by traffickers from Amazonian areas and are illegally sold in Lima.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/17258/production/_121480849_scott_getty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-59220074,80,2021-11-09T11:29:37.000Z,politics
52,Man shot by Kyle Rittenhouse says he pointed own gun amid fears for life,"A man who survived after being shot by a US teenager during racial justice protests in Wisconsin has told a court that he pointed his own gun, but had no intention of firing it.Gaige Grosskreutz was the third person to be shot by Kyle Rittenhouse in the city of Kenosha on 25 August 2020.He said he thought Mr Rittenhouse was an ""active shooter"" when he drew his own gun and advanced on him.Mr Rittenhouse then opened fire, shooting him in the arm, he said. Lawyers for Mr Rittenhouse argue that he was acting in self-defence. The 18-year-old has denied six charges, including reckless homicide, intentional homicide and recklessly endangering safety.Riots erupted in Kenosha in August 2020 after police shot a black man. Mr Rittenhouse had travelled to the city from his home in Illinois the day before and, with a semi-automatic rifle in tow, he claimed he sought to help protect property from unrest on the streets.Mr Grosskreutz, 27, was at the protest volunteering as a medic and said in court that he was affiliated with a social justice group called the People's Revolution Movement, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Under tense cross-examination on Monday, the defendant's lawyer, Corey Chirafisi, asked Mr Grosskreutz: ""When you were standing three to five feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?""""Correct,"" Mr Grosskreutz said.""It wasn't until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun, now your hands down pointed at him, that he fired, right?"" Mr Chirafisi continued.""Correct,"" Mr Grosskreutz said.He said he did not mean to point the gun at Mr Rittenhouse and also denied he had been chasing after the teen, who was aged 17 at the time. Asked what was going through his mind as he got close to Mr Rittenhouse, he said: ""That I was going to die.""""I was never trying to kill the defendant. In that moment, I was trying to preserve my own life, but doing so while taking the life of another is not something I am capable or comfortable doing,"" he told the court.  Armed with a semi-automatic rifle, Mr Rittenhouse had just fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, who had swung a skateboard at him. Mr Rittenhouse and the men he shot are all white.Mr Grosskreutz was shot in the right bicep, causing severe damage to his arm. Pictures of his wound were shown to the jury, causing some to look away in discomfort, according to court reporters. Mr Grosskreutz was the 16th witness to testify for the prosecution. Mr Rittenhouse's defence team are expected to call their own witnesses after the prosecution closes on Tuesday.  The rioting broke out in Kenosha after police shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back on 23 August 2020. A woman had called police to say Mr Blake was at her home in violation of a restraining order. Mr Blake, who had a knife, was getting into a car where his three children were seated when police opened fire. He survived but was paralysed from the waist down.Bystander video captures Mr Rittenhouse being chased into the car park of a used-car dealership by Mr Rosenbaum.Moments later, unseen on video, Mr Rittenhouse fires four times and kills Mr Rosenbaum.As he runs down the street away from the scene, Mr Rittenhouse falls and multiple people converge upon him.Mr Huber hits Mr Rittenhouse in the head and neck with a skateboard. Mr Rittenhouse kills him with a bullet to the stomach.Mr Grosskreutz approaches him with a pistol in hand. Mr Rittenhouse wounds him with a shot in the arm.If convicted of the most serious charges, he could spend decades in prison.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/66F6/production/_121485362_gettyimages-1236442647.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59216106,80,2021-11-09T15:17:17.000Z,politics
53,Travis Scott festival tragedy: Were warning signs missed at Astroworld?,"For almost 40 minutes after Houston police and firefighters responded to a ""mass casualty"" event at Travis Scott's packed Astroworld music festival on Friday, the superstar continued to perform.By the time he left the stage, it had become one of the deadliest concerts in US history. Eight people died and dozens more were injured. Fans were filmed chanting ""stop the show"" and pleading for staff to help. One even climbed onto a camera platform to point out the injured.Scott eventually ended his set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time. But questions remain about why it didn't finish sooner.""Nine thirty, right there. That's when a few people started going down,"" Houston police chief Troy Finner said at a press conference on Saturday. ""Our people stepped up and immediately went to the producers and told them, 'Hey, we got people going down.' This show ended at 10:10pm. I just wanted to acknowledge that.""Scott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched the event with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. He said in an Instagram video that he was not aware how bad things had become during his headline set this year.""Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need,"" he said. ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.""In footage from the concert, he can be seen interrupting his performance to ask for help for a fan who had passed out.However in another another video, he can be heard saying during another break: ""Who asked you to stop? Y'all know what y'all came to do - chase me, let's go.""The rapper is known for his wild shows, and has been in trouble for inciting dangerous behaviour in the past.In 2015, he was charged with disorderly conduct after encouraging fans in Chicago to ignore security and rush the stage.Two years later, he spotted a fan hanging from a venue's second-storey balcony and tried to persuade them to jump. At the same concert, a 27-year-old fan was paralysed after being pushed off a third-floor balcony.In 2019, hundreds of fans rushed the Astroworld barriers, with three people going to hospital with minor injuries. Police wrote on Twitter that the event was understaffed and that ""promoters did not plan sufficiently for the large crowds"", although the statement was later deleted.Fears about crowd safety had been raised before this year's event. A security plan obtained by the New York Times addressed several areas of concern.""Based on the site's layout and numerous past experiences, the potential for multiple alcohol/drug related incidents, possible evacuation needs, and the ever-present threat of a mass casualty situation are identified as key concerns,"" the document read.Before Scott took to the stage, local news teams filmed fans bursting through gates and bypassing security checkpoints.The city's police chief also visited the star in his dressing room to convey concerns about the energy in the crowd.In a statement, Chief Finner said the ""brief and respectful meeting"" allowed him to ""share my public safety concerns"" and ask the star ""to be mindful of his team's social media messaging on any unscheduled events."" So how could this tragedy happen?Investigators will look at a number of factors, says Simon Ancliffe, founder of Movement Strategies, which advises major UK events like Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds and the 2012 Olympics on crowd safety.""Have they controlled numbers? Are there barriers in place and were they well designed? Were security staff doing what they're supposed to do? Did they have good situational awareness? Did they have CCTV?""They did seem have to some kind of procedure to stop the show, but it seemed to stop and start - so was [the situation] about communications, was it about decision making?""When tragedies occur, he says, it's often not about one bad decision but an accumulation of smaller mistakes that ultimately lead to catastrophe. In this case, ""it sounds like a lot of things went wrong"".""It all comes down to planning,"" says Keith Still, a professor of crowd science at the University of Sussex.""You need to anticipate that this type of performer in that type of environment will induce this type of behaviour in the crowd - and you put crowd management and monitoring systems in place to make sure that you've got an early warning indicator.""Ancliffe says the teams on the ground are not necessarily to blame.""The security staff on the barriers can see what's immediately in front of them, but [only] a few people deep,"" he says, explaining that frontline staff need back-up in the form of CCTV or a more elevated view of the audience.In the UK, ""we have experienced crowd managers with a really good view of the crowd from a raised position, so you can see people's faces and look for the change in expression"", says Eric Stuart, chair of the UK Crowd Management Association. ""There's always going to be people screaming because they're having fun. The skill and the artform is looking at the faces and listening to the screams and saying, 'That's different. Things have changed.'""Many people in an audience often aren't aware of a life-threatening situation until it's too late.""When you're in a crowd, you can't see more than a couple of people in front of you, and you can't hear what's going on because of the music,"" says Ancliffe. ""So there's really bad information transfer within the crowd.""If people are pushing forwards, they can't see what's in front of them. And once you've fallen down, it's very difficult to get up again, unless people are helping you. And if people have bent over to help you, then they can be pushed over very easily as well.""So it's up to staff to identify problems and alert the performer, who can pause the show and calm the situation.In this case, it was the audience who notified security and were ""asking for things to change"", says Ancliffe.""So what was the situational awareness? What was the decision making? There may be other factors involved, but those will probably be the things where the disaster happened.""Some experts have also suggested Scott's decision to play on a separate stage with no other acts scheduled at the same time could have exacerbated the situation.That goes against a common practice in crowd management, known as ""spreading the field"", where organisers arrange several competing headliners or stagger stage times to control the flow of fans.But Scott's performance came 45 minutes after SZA had ended the day's final set on Astroworld's second stage. Fans who had been gathering near the barriers of his $5m ""Utopia Mountain"" arena since lunchtime were suddenly met with an influx of revellers, hyped up by a massive countdown clock heralding the star's arrival.""The crux of the problem likely happened as the clock got close to zero,"" one unnamed source told Variety magazine.One teenage fan said she got into difficulties almost immediately.""Once Travis Scott came on, I told myself this is the moment I've been preparing for, I just need to breathe,"" Diana Amira told NBC news. ""But... my ribcage was so squished that I couldn't expand my lungs to catch a breath.""Thankfully, crowd-related deaths at music events are relatively few and far between.""The first thing to say is that if you have an experienced crowd team on site, it won't reach that stage,"" Eric Stuart tells BBC Radio 5 Live.""If the worst comes to worst, there's a small group of people who have what we call the 'red card', and it is literally a message to the stage manager that we need to cut the music, we need to stop. ""And then we need to engage the artist for him or her to speak to the crowd. Ideally, we don't want a guy or girl in the high-vis jacket or the police coming on stage and talking to the crowd. The artist is the best person to do that.""That seems to have happened during Friday's concert. The question for investigators will be why the music continued after the initial call for help.In his video statement, Scott said he was ""working closely with everyone to get to the bottom of this"" and described himself as ""honestly just devastated"". Steve Adelman, vice president and lead counsel for the Event Safety Alliance, urged against apportioning blame at this stage. ""There is the instinct to rush to judgment before we know what actually happened,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine.Ancliffe hopes an inquiry will encourage promoters to ""tighten up their procedures or [concert] designs"".But Prof Still adds: ""If you look at any other safety-related industry - aviation, for example - if there's a near miss or a close call there's an investigation by experts, and new procedures are put into place to prevent that happening again.""Unfortunately, in the events industry, it comes down to litigation and it's generally settled out of court. I know, because I'm an expert witness in a number of international cases.""The court documents get sealed, the information never gets fed back into the industry and so there's no learning, there's no improvement.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

54,Sierra Leone tanker explosion: Survivors try to rebuild lives,"In the wake of the fuel tanker explosion that killed 115 people in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, survivors and their families are left wondering how to rebuild their lives, as BBC West Africa correspondent Mayeni Jones reports.In the mid-afternoon heat, health workers in protective clothing nail Sierra Leonean flags to wooden coffins. In the middle of the flags are the words ""Rest in Peace"". A crowd gathers to watch them work - a mix of bystanders and medical staff from the Connaught Hospital in downtown Freetown, where the bodies are being loaded. Some of the onlookers cover their noses. The smell of the bodies hangs in the hot, humid air. At the sight of the coffins being loaded onto the truck, a woman whose nephew is being treated for severe burns in the hospital bursts into tears. ""Oh God, eh God!"" she repeats, holding a handkerchief to her face and wiping away her tears, her shoulders shaking as she sobs. Between a civil war, a range of natural disasters and the Ebola crisis of 2014, Sierra Leoneans have been through more collective grief than most. The country ranks 182nd out of 189 in the UN's Human Development Index, which measures countries' levels of social and economic development based on four criteria: life expectancy at birth, average years spent in school, expected years of education and gross national income per capita. Despite its abundant mineral wealth, Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries on earth, and its population has had to learn resilience.Still, this latest tragedy has left many shaken. ""A medical emergency of this magnitude I've never experienced before in all my career as a medical doctor,"" says Dr Mustapha Kabbah, a surgeon at Connaught Hospital with 20 years' experience. He moved back to Sierra Leone with his family from Germany in 2018. ""This is big, it's really massive. On that day when I saw the incident, I was really taken aback. We're still yet to understand what happened, because it's just too soon.""In the corridors of the hospital, I speak to 25-year-old Victoria Fornah, a student at the historic Fourah Bay College, founded almost 200 years ago. Her older brother Ibrahim got caught in the blaze while coming home on Friday night. She found out he had been in the accident on social media. ""I was sleeping, so my sister called me and said 'just check your phone'. When I opened it I saw pictures of my brother lying on the ground, everywhere was burned."" Ibrahim has severe burns on his arms, face and feet. Victoria says he's been responding well to treatment. ""Although his injuries were many, we thank God for his life.""At the scene of the accident, in Freetown's eastern suburb of Wellington, the smell of burnt rubber still hangs in the air more than 48 hours after the blaze. In a local bar, smoke rises from a pile of ashes. Blackened cars and engines are a reminder of the horror that took place here on Friday. Members of the community and local business owners stand around surveying the damage. Many used their life savings to open these businesses. Now they have nothing left. Twenty-eight-year-old orphan Aisatu Sesay is a nurse at a local hospital. She opened a small pharmacy with her sister to supplement her income. Back in July they lost their house in an electric fire. They had moved their savings, as well as the donations they were given to help with the loss of their home, to their pharmacy. Now that's gone too. ""Everything is gone, my documents, the pharmacy documents, it's all burned. I have no idea what I'll do,"" Ms Sesay says. She was getting back from work when she saw people running with the spilt fuel from the truck. When the fire started she tried to run away but got pushed to the ground by people fleeing the scene. She shows me her bandaged calf and a bruise on her thigh. ""Lots of people died because they fell and simply couldn't get back up."" She's worried about her future. Her whole family has had to move back to the orphanage where she grew up because they have nowhere else to go. ""It was so difficult for us to open our business because we didn't have much money and no family to help us, but we raised it over time. ""But now all of our money is burned.""During a mass burial for victims on Monday night, President Julius Maada Bio reiterated his promise that a thorough investigation would be conducted to make sure something like this never happened again. But for the victims and their families, surviving is more important than promises.

55,Rwanda goes electric with locally made motorbikes,"For 12 years Didier Ndabahariye has been ferrying passengers around the streets of Kigali - one of the thousands of motorbike taxi drivers, known locally as a motos.Recently, he switched his usual ride for getting around Rwanda's capital for one of the first electric motorbikes on the African continent.""In the first days, things were not good because I was not used to riding e-motos and the bike sometimes cut-off.""However I went on working, and soon I knew many things about how the bike works and how to ride it. Then I started saving more money,"" Didier explains.He is one of 60 drivers riding an electric motorbike from the Rwandan firm Ampersand. ""Now I like the bikes - an e-moto can last for a long time without any problems unlike with an engine motor -  and it goes well, it is very smooth to ride.""The start-up Ampersand is pioneering the switch and hopes that over the next five years almost all of Rwanda's motorbikes will be electric.It is an ambitious dream - there are around 25,000 motorbike taxis operating in Kigali, some driving up to 10 hours a day, often covering hundreds of kilometres daily. ""Motorbikes make up more than half of all vehicles in this part of the world,"" says Ampersand chief executive Josh Whale. ""Their simple engines lack the sort of costly emissions reduction tech that you see in modern cars, or in motorbikes in the global north. Meanwhile they are being run for over 100km per day, so that's a lot of pollution, a lot of carbon [dioxide]. More Technology of Business""In Rwanda, drivers spend more in a year on petrol than the cost of a new motorbike. We've shown that we can offer an alternative in the same style as their current motorbike [that] costs less to buy, less to power and less to maintain.""Ampersand says that savings on fuel and maintenance can double a driver's income.With an estimated five million motorbikes on the roads of East Africa, there could be big savings in CO2 emissions if Ampersand and its rivals take a significant share of the market.Ampersand is more than just a technology platform. It assembles the motorbikes, the batteries and has set up charging stations.  Each motorbike has around 150 parts, which are assembled in Kigali. Particularly importantly, the battery packs are specially designed and prototyped by Ampersand engineers in Rwanda. They are then manufactured abroad and shipped back to Rwanda for final assembly by local technicians.Ampersand currently has 73 employees at its Rwandan motorcycle factory and is moving to a new facility this month as production grows.""For the time being we also happen to be a motorbike company, with spare parts and maintenance too. However we'd be glad to work with the big existing petrol motorbike manufacturers on the vehicle side of things.""We are still small and we want to move fast - as the climate crisis demands - and do some hard things quickly. So we're very happy to team up with big existing players where we can,"" Mr Whale says.The company has set up battery swap stations - where drivers exchange their depleted batteries for recharged ones - with five already in operation around Kigali.Each swap station costs around $5,000 (£3,700) - and the firm says it can build about 20 swap stations for the price of one conventional petrol station.Rwanda's government has a large role to play in moving to e-transportation, balancing the pros and cons of e-mobility. There will be a loss of fuel tax revenue - but the benefits include a shift to locally produced power sources, lower fuel importation costs and job creation if assembly takes place locally. The country has pioneered a range of incentives to encourage e-mobility.This includes capped electricity tariffs for charging stations and rent-free land for them, preferential parking and travel lanes for electric vehicles around Kigali, and restrictions on the ages and emissions of polluting vehicles.Established transport companies are also showing willingness to contribute to e-mobility efforts.In Rwanda, Volkswagen has been conducting an e-mobility pilot project since 2019 in partnership with Siemens, which has seen it launch 20 electric Golfs and two charging stations in Kigali.Volkswagen says the country has the potential to leapfrog internal combustion engines to electric cars.""Together with our development partner Siemens and with support from the government of Rwanda, Volkswagen aims to make the e-Golf pilot project a blueprint for electric mobility in Africa,"" says Andile Dlamini, of Volkswagen Group South Africa.For Ampersand, Rwanda has only been the first step in Africa, with the company currently launching in neighbouring Kenya and other countries shortly afterwards.  While there are challenges to rolling out electric vehicles across Africa - such as a shortage of specialised skills, the reticence of venture capital investors and disrupted supply chains - Mr Whale argues that the continent can be a leader in a global shift to e-mobility.The amount of working capital required is ""easily realistic"", he says, and could be put up by world governments to speed up roll out.  ""We hope we can show that the electric age is here - for everyone - and clean mobility isn't something that's just going to trickle down to the global south in a second-hand manner, decades from now.  Rather that it's cost-effective, fundable, investable - now.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/45CB/production/_121476871_amper.didier1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58820548,80,2021-11-09T00:00:30.000Z,politics

57,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

58,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,politics
59,What is COP26 and what was agreed at Glasgow climate conference?,"The UK is hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow - aimed at bringing climate change under control.A number of pledges have already been made, which could change our everyday lives.The world is warming because of emissions from fossil fuels used by humans, like coal, oil and gas. Extreme weather events linked to climate change - including heatwaves, floods and forest fires - are intensifying. The past decade was the warmest on record and governments agree urgent collective action is needed.For COP26, 200 countries have been asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. They already agreed in 2015 to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C - in order to prevent a climate catastrophe.This is what's known as the Paris Agreement. It means countries have to keep cutting emissions until reaching net zero in 2050.There has been a flurry of new announcements, with more expected:What is the announcement?Leaders from more than 100 world countries, representing about 85% of the world's forests, promised to stop deforestation by 2030.Why it matters?Trees can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) - one of the key greenhouse gases adding to global warming. So, ending deforestation is seen as a vital way to tackle climate change. Does it go far enough?Similar initiatives before haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed or monitored. And Indonesia, one of the main signatories, later said the plan was ""unfair"".What is the announcement?A scheme to cut 30% of current methane emissions by 2030 has been agreed by more than 100 countries. Why it matters?Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The majority comes from a range of activities, such as cattle production and waste disposal.Does it go far enough?The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.What is the announcement?More than 40 countries - which include major coal-users including Poland, Vietnam and Chile - agreed to shift away from coal.Why it matters?Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. Although progress has been made in reducing its use, it still produced about 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. Does it go far enough?Some of the world's most coal-dependent countries, including Australia, India, China and the US, haven't signed up. And the agreement doesn't cover other fossil fuels such as oil or gasWhat is the announcement?Some 450 financial organisations, who between them control $130tn, agreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.Why it matters?The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets, and to commit them to providing finance for green technology.Does it go far enough?There is no set definition yet as to what net zero targets actually are. Also, some environmental organisations have said that without a greater commitment to ending fossil-fuel finance, this initiative may amount to little more than a PR exercise. For the most part, any commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. However, there's a hope that as momentum towards net zero accelerates, it will encourage countries to keep up.It would be possible in theory to impose sanctions on countries that don't. But it could also be counter-productive, or see nations withdraw from international agreements. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage every country to stay involved.Top image from Getty Images.

60,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. ""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. ""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.""The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.""""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.""Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP.""The likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,"" said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis. ""If we're serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.""The BBC asked the UN body responsible for accrediting delegates about its procedures, but has not received a reply.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/919A/production/_121147273_3_fossil_fuel_getty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484,80,2021-11-08T00:14:06.000Z,politics
61,Rich countries ‘pushing back’ on paying for climate loss,"Vulnerable countries at COP26 say rich nations are pushing back against their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change.Poorer countries see it as critical that money for loss and damage be part of negotiations this week. Negotiators agreed in Paris in 2015 to address the issue, but there is no agreement on who should pay for it.Rich nations are said to be resisting any commitments as they do not want to accept liability and risk being sued.Developing countries argue that rich countries are responsible for most of today's climate change impacts because they started emitting carbon much earlier than the rest of the world.""Loss and damage is still a taboo for developed countries,"" said Alpha Oumar Kaloga, one of the lead negotiators of the Africa Group, who also represents Guinea in the Least Developed Countries bloc (LDC). The majority of the 46 countries in the LDC bloc are in Africa.""During negotiations, we have been repeatedly arguing that loss and damage needs to be mentioned in a separate column in the climate finance reporting papers of developed countries, because such losses and damages are happening all over the world,"" Mr Kaloga said.The resistance from rich countries behind closed doors is particularly frustrating when they are at the same time ""talking about transparency in this whole process.""A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) this year showed that in 2019, about 25% of climate finance from developed countries went towards adaptation - preparing for extreme weather events, or building seawalls, for example - while the rest went to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions.Poor countries say climate change is impacting on communities with such intensity that they can no longer adapt, but instead need financial support to rebuild, or to move away.As holder of the COP presidency, the UK has been co-ordinating the talks. A spokesperson said the UK was ""listening to the views of all parties and the final text will be agreed by consensus"". Le-Anne Roper, lead negotiator on loss and damage for the Alliance of Small Island States, wants a new finance goal just for loss and damage. This would be separate from the $100bn (£74bn) already pledged - a target the world has already missed for 2020 which is now set for 2023.""It is the only way we will be able to give our people a better chance at surviving, given the growing scale of the crisis and the need for significant action to address loss and damage,"" she told the BBC.Harjeet Singh, senior adviser for Climate Action Network International, said climate change was destroying entire communities.""This is about providing relief, rehabilitation and support to those who are simply displaced forever,"" he said.There were no immediate comments from loss and damage negotiators from some developed countries contacted by the BBC.There has been criticism from developing countries that adaptation has not received enough attention at COP26, and that the agenda has been dominated by carbon emissions reduction which has to do mainly with developed nations and fast-emerging economies like China and India.   Several poor countries have also come under criticism for not making best use of the funds made available to them. Experts say issues like bad governance and corruption have been a major challenge in implementing adaptation projects.

62,Climate change: Can India meet its targets?,"India's Prime Narendra Modi has set his country a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070, a significantly later deadline than many other countries attending the Glasgow climate summit.India also set itself a deadline of 2030 to reduce its emissions by one billion tonnes. After China and the US, India is the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2). With its rapidly growing population and an economy heavily dependent on coal and oil, its emissions are on a steep upward trajectory unless action is taken to curb them.India has resisted setting overall reduction targets, saying industrialised nations should bear a much greater share of the burden as they have contributed far more towards global warming over time. It says an ""emissions intensity"" target, which measures emissions per unit of economic growth, is a fairer way to compare it with other countries, it says.  By 2030 Mr Modi say India will reduce the emissions intensity of its economy by 45% (that's of all greenhouse gases not just CO2) - a more ambitious target than the previous goal of a 33-35% cut in its emissions intensity from the 2005 level by 2030.But a fall in carbon emissions intensity does not necessarily mean a reduction in overall emissions.Climate Action Tracker (CAT), which monitors government policies and actions, says the target is unlikely to have an impact on limiting overall projected emissions.The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a target of global net zero - where a country is not adding to the overall amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050 is the minimum needed to keep the temperature rise to 1.5C.And more than 140 countries have publicly promised to meet this.India's prime minister has pledged that it will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.It currently has a capacity of around just 100GW and had previously set itself a target of reaching 175GW by next year, which it looks likely to miss.Although the new target for 2030 is more ambitious, it will only have a ""small impact on real-world emissions,"" says Climate Action Tracker.Also in 2015, India promised to provide 40% of all electric power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.  Mr Modi has now increased this figure to 50%.Generation capacity from these sources stands at around 39% as of September this year, according to India's official statistics.But the actual amount generated in 2020 was lower at around 20%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Cindy Baxter, of CAT, says developing countries such as India, need international support to decarbonise their economies and limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in line with the Paris Agreement. ""India does not have a conditional target that identifies where it needs support or indeed how much support it needs.""India has highlighted many times it wants to bring a third of its land area under forest cover. But it has not given a timescale for this - and progress has been patchy.Although there have been replanting initiatives in the southern parts of India, the north-eastern region has lost forest cover recently.The expansion of green cover acts a carbon sink.And India plans to plant enough trees by 2030 to absorb an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.Global Forest Watch - a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Google, the United States Geological Survey and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) - estimates India lost 18% of its primary forests and 5% of its tree cover between 2001 and 2020. But the Indian government's own survey data indicates a 5.2% increase in forest cover between 2001 and 2019.This is because the GFW report includes only vegetation taller than 5m (16ft) whereas India's official calculation is based on tree density over a given area of land.Additional research by David BrownThe Cop26 global summit, in Glasgow, in November, is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

64,Nagaenthran: Family prays for miracle to halt execution of man with low IQ,"Sarmila Dharmalingam is praying for a miracle. Her brother, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, is set to be hanged in Singapore's Changi Prison. ""When I'm alone and I think of my brother, there is pain. But [we need to] be brave and keep on praying - anything can happen,"" she told the BBC.In 2009, then 21-year-old Nagaenthran was caught trying to smuggle heroin into Singapore from Malaysia. Nagaenthran was initially due to be hanged on Wednesday morning, but was granted a last-minute stay of execution. On Tuesday he was found to have Covid-19 and the execution was further delayed.The Malaysian citizen was sentenced to death despite an assessment by a medical expert that he has an IQ of 69 - a level recognised as indicating an intellectual disability. But the Singapore government said he ""clearly understood the nature of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing"". Singapore has one of the world's toughest drug laws and locally, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial. But this case appears to have sparked a rare disquiet in the island nation.More than 60,000 people have now signed a petition calling for Singapore's president to pardon Nagaenthran, citing the fact that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law.  ""It is completely disheartening that an intellectually disabled man is being punished for a non-violent crime,"" said one person who signed the petition. ""Neither he nor his family deserve this pain. Please save him.""The movement has also gained traction on social media, where there is an unusual outpouring of anger and sympathy. Sarmila says she's not clear if the 33-year-old himself understands how dire his situation is. ""Sometimes he calls me and tells me he is going to be hanged and that he needs to get ready,"" she told the BBC.""[Other times] he says he wants to come back home to eat home-cooked food. I don't know whether or not he knows [what's about to happen].""If he is hanged it will be the first execution Singapore has carried out since 2019. In 2009, Nagaenthran was caught crossing into Singapore from Malaysia with 43g (1.5oz) heroin strapped on to his left thigh. Under Singapore's laws, those caught carrying more than 15g of heroin will be subject to the death penalty. During his trial, he initially said he was coerced into carrying the drugs, but later said he had committed the offence because he needed money. The court said his initial defence was ""fabricated"". He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging. In 2015, he appealed to have his sentence commuted to life in prison on the basis that he suffered from an intellectual disability. In 2017 one psychiatrist, Dr Ken Ung, said that Nagaenthran suffered from a mild intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a drinking disorder - all of which would have ""significantly affected his judgement [and] decision making"". In cross examination, Dr Ung appeared to contradict himself and said Nagaenthran could instead be suffering from borderline intellectual functioning.While three other psychiatrists told the court that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled, one found that his ""borderline intelligence may have contributed towards his... agreeing to carry out the offence"". In the end, the court found that he was not intellectually disabled. A final push for presidential clemency was also rejected last year. ""The Court of Appeal found that this was the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question,"" said Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs in a statement. Global rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned the verdict.""Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International's Singapore Researcher.The case has also caused outrage in Nagaenthran's home country Malaysia where protests have been held calling for the execution to be halted.Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has also personally appealed to his Singaporean counterpart.After 10 years on death row, Sarmila received a letter sent by the Singapore Prison Service saying Nagaenthran's execution had been set for 10 November.""I couldn't accept it... I was crying. I cried the whole day. I was so afraid to tell my mother because she suffers from [some] health conditions.

69,Climate change: Can India meet its targets?,"India's Prime Narendra Modi has set his country a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070, a significantly later deadline than many other countries attending the Glasgow climate summit.India also set itself a deadline of 2030 to reduce its emissions by one billion tonnes. After China and the US, India is the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2). With its rapidly growing population and an economy heavily dependent on coal and oil, its emissions are on a steep upward trajectory unless action is taken to curb them.India has resisted setting overall reduction targets, saying industrialised nations should bear a much greater share of the burden as they have contributed far more towards global warming over time. It says an ""emissions intensity"" target, which measures emissions per unit of economic growth, is a fairer way to compare it with other countries, it says.  By 2030 Mr Modi say India will reduce the emissions intensity of its economy by 45% (that's of all greenhouse gases not just CO2) - a more ambitious target than the previous goal of a 33-35% cut in its emissions intensity from the 2005 level by 2030.But a fall in carbon emissions intensity does not necessarily mean a reduction in overall emissions.Climate Action Tracker (CAT), which monitors government policies and actions, says the target is unlikely to have an impact on limiting overall projected emissions.The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a target of global net zero - where a country is not adding to the overall amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050 is the minimum needed to keep the temperature rise to 1.5C.And more than 140 countries have publicly promised to meet this.India's prime minister has pledged that it will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.It currently has a capacity of around just 100GW and had previously set itself a target of reaching 175GW by next year, which it looks likely to miss.Although the new target for 2030 is more ambitious, it will only have a ""small impact on real-world emissions,"" says Climate Action Tracker.Also in 2015, India promised to provide 40% of all electric power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.  Mr Modi has now increased this figure to 50%.Generation capacity from these sources stands at around 39% as of September this year, according to India's official statistics.But the actual amount generated in 2020 was lower at around 20%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Cindy Baxter, of CAT, says developing countries such as India, need international support to decarbonise their economies and limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in line with the Paris Agreement. ""India does not have a conditional target that identifies where it needs support or indeed how much support it needs.""India has highlighted many times it wants to bring a third of its land area under forest cover. But it has not given a timescale for this - and progress has been patchy.Although there have been replanting initiatives in the southern parts of India, the north-eastern region has lost forest cover recently.The expansion of green cover acts a carbon sink.And India plans to plant enough trees by 2030 to absorb an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.Global Forest Watch - a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Google, the United States Geological Survey and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) - estimates India lost 18% of its primary forests and 5% of its tree cover between 2001 and 2020. But the Indian government's own survey data indicates a 5.2% increase in forest cover between 2001 and 2019.This is because the GFW report includes only vegetation taller than 5m (16ft) whereas India's official calculation is based on tree density over a given area of land.Additional research by David BrownThe Cop26 global summit, in Glasgow, in November, is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions - and it could lead to major changes to everyday lives.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/92B2/production/_121245573_gettyimages-1231813272.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58922398,80,2021-11-09T16:08:51.000Z,politics
70,Nagaenthran: Family prays for miracle to halt execution of man with low IQ,"Sarmila Dharmalingam is praying for a miracle. Her brother, Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, is set to be hanged in Singapore's Changi Prison. ""When I'm alone and I think of my brother, there is pain. But [we need to] be brave and keep on praying - anything can happen,"" she told the BBC.In 2009, then 21-year-old Nagaenthran was caught trying to smuggle heroin into Singapore from Malaysia. Nagaenthran was initially due to be hanged on Wednesday morning, but was granted a last-minute stay of execution. On Tuesday he was found to have Covid-19 and the execution was further delayed.The Malaysian citizen was sentenced to death despite an assessment by a medical expert that he has an IQ of 69 - a level recognised as indicating an intellectual disability. But the Singapore government said he ""clearly understood the nature of his acts and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing"". Singapore has one of the world's toughest drug laws and locally, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial. But this case appears to have sparked a rare disquiet in the island nation.More than 60,000 people have now signed a petition calling for Singapore's president to pardon Nagaenthran, citing the fact that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law.  ""It is completely disheartening that an intellectually disabled man is being punished for a non-violent crime,"" said one person who signed the petition. ""Neither he nor his family deserve this pain. Please save him.""The movement has also gained traction on social media, where there is an unusual outpouring of anger and sympathy. Sarmila says she's not clear if the 33-year-old himself understands how dire his situation is. ""Sometimes he calls me and tells me he is going to be hanged and that he needs to get ready,"" she told the BBC.""[Other times] he says he wants to come back home to eat home-cooked food. I don't know whether or not he knows [what's about to happen].""If he is hanged it will be the first execution Singapore has carried out since 2019. In 2009, Nagaenthran was caught crossing into Singapore from Malaysia with 43g (1.5oz) heroin strapped on to his left thigh. Under Singapore's laws, those caught carrying more than 15g of heroin will be subject to the death penalty. During his trial, he initially said he was coerced into carrying the drugs, but later said he had committed the offence because he needed money. The court said his initial defence was ""fabricated"". He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging. In 2015, he appealed to have his sentence commuted to life in prison on the basis that he suffered from an intellectual disability. In 2017 one psychiatrist, Dr Ken Ung, said that Nagaenthran suffered from a mild intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a drinking disorder - all of which would have ""significantly affected his judgement [and] decision making"". In cross examination, Dr Ung appeared to contradict himself and said Nagaenthran could instead be suffering from borderline intellectual functioning.While three other psychiatrists told the court that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled, one found that his ""borderline intelligence may have contributed towards his... agreeing to carry out the offence"". In the end, the court found that he was not intellectually disabled. A final push for presidential clemency was also rejected last year. ""The Court of Appeal found that this was the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question,"" said Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs in a statement. Global rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned the verdict.""Taking people's lives is a cruel act in itself but to hang a person convicted merely of carrying drugs, amid chilling testimony that he might not even fully understand what is happening to him, is despicable,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International's Singapore Researcher.The case has also caused outrage in Nagaenthran's home country Malaysia where protests have been held calling for the execution to be halted.Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has also personally appealed to his Singaporean counterpart.After 10 years on death row, Sarmila received a letter sent by the Singapore Prison Service saying Nagaenthran's execution had been set for 10 November.""I couldn't accept it... I was crying. I cried the whole day. I was so afraid to tell my mother because she suffers from [some] health conditions. I couldn't look her in the face.""The family was given around two weeks to arrange travel, hotel quarantine and the Covid tests they would need to enter Singapore. Activists have highlighted the additional challenges of travelling during a pandemic. ""[The family has to] make health declarations, get travel insurance, find their own accommodation [among others]... [and they] are expected to foot the bill for all this,"" activist Kirsten Han, who started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the family told the BBC. ""It's a tremendous amount of money for a Malaysian family, and there are still [other] expenses to consider, as well as potential funeral costs.""

76,Cleo Smith abduction: Australian police investigate 'if anyone else involved',"Australian police are investigating whether another person may have been involved in the abduction of four-year-old Cleo Smith, who was rescued from a stranger's home last week.Cleo was missing for 18 days after she vanished from her family's camping trip in Western Australia on 16 October.Her disappearance sparked a massive search that ended in police finding the girl in her hometown of Carnarvon.Terence Darrell Kelly, 36, has been charged with kidnapping offences.He was flown to a maximum security prison in Perth, 900km (560 miles) south of Carnarvon, last Friday.But lead detectives in the case returned to the small coastal town on Monday.""Our focus this week is for us to ascertain if there was anyone else involved. That's why we're still here,"" Detective Senior Sgt Cameron Blaine told reporters at the town's airport.He called for any locals who had seen or had any contact with Mr Kelly in recent weeks to come forward.At the time of the rescue, police said they believed Mr Kelly had been acting alone. They have disclosed little information since then.On Tuesday, the Daily Mail Australia reported that police were investigating whether a woman had helped care for Cleo during the abduction - including by helping her to dress and brush her hair. Police have not commented on the report.Cleo was found safe and well last Wednesday after police smashed their way into the house at night-time, just an hour after arresting Mr Kelly.Vision of the rescue showed the young girl identifying herself to officers and smiling.Her family has since released a statement saying they are ""so thankful that our little girl is back within our arms"".Mr Kelly was taken to hospital with self-inflicted injuries shortly after he was arrested. He appeared in court last Thursday charged with forcibly or fraudulently taking or enticing a child under the age of 16, among other offences.He is next due to face court in early December.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D824/production/_121323355_fdpnyz9uyaocxmz-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-59215945,80,2021-11-09T01:05:21.000Z,politics
77,Zhang Zhan: US asks China to free jailed Wuhan citizen journalist,"The US state department has urged China to release citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, expressing deep concerns over her deteriorating health.She was given a four-year jail term over her reporting of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan when the pandemic began.Zhang has been on an intermittent hunger strike since she was detained in May last year.The US moves comes after reports that she is perilously close to death. ""We have repeatedly expressed our serious concerns about the arbitrary nature of her detention and her mistreatment during it,"" US State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters. ""We reiterate our call to the PRC for her immediate and unconditional release.""Zhang, a 38-year-old former lawyer, had initially travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 after reading an online post by a resident about life in the city during the outbreak.Once there, she began documenting what she saw on the streets and hospitals in livestreams and essays, despite threats by authorities, and her reports were widely shared on social mediaIn May she was found guilty of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"" - a charge that is commonly levelled against activists and whistle blowers seen as undermining the government's efforts to control information in the country. Zhang started a hunger strike in protest while in jail. Since then, she has drastically lost weight and reportedly been held in physical restraints and force-fed through a tube.Her family have sought medical parole amidst fears she will not make it through the winter.

79,Evergrande: Crisis-hit developer raises more cash as new deadline looms,"Cash-strapped Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has raised around $145m (£107m) just before a deadline for a fresh debt interest payment.The company has sold a 5.7% stake in media firm HengTen Networks Group which produces films and television shows, and operates a streaming platform.Evergrande needs to make overdue interest payments of $148m this week.It has so far avoided defaulting on its debts by making overdue payments just before 30-day grace periods expired.Evergrande owned a majority stake in HengTen at the beginning of this year, but has since made a number of share sales as it tries to raise money to meet its financial commitments.HengTen's other big corporate shareholder is Chinese technology giant Tencent - it bought a 7% stake from Evergrande for about $266m in July.The latest share sale now makes Tencent the media company's biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 24%.Apart from HengTen, Evergrande also sold its UK-based electric motor making business Protean in the last week.It didn't say how much it earned from the sale of the company, which its vehicle manufacturing unit bought for $58m in 2019.However, Evergrande has struggled to sell some of its other assets in recent months as it attempts to raise the money needed to make debt interest payments.Last month, the company halted trading in its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ahead of an announcement on a ""major transaction"".Then, after a 17-day suspension Evergrande said a $2.6bn deal to sell a stake in its property services unit had fallen through as it was unable to agree to the deal's terms.Evergrande's $300bn debt mountain and the company's problems with making debt repayments have triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/39A6/production/_121485741_tv071460717.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59216504,80,2021-11-09T04:45:50.000Z,politics
80,Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms,"This is a country that is starting to feel the very real fear of hunger.  The weather is turning from early autumn warmth to a sharp chill. Several areas are reporting drought, which adds to the sense of growing catastrophe.  At Maidan Wardak, 50 miles west of Kabul, a crowd of several hundred men had gathered in the hope of getting flour from an official distribution point. The flour was provided by the World Food Programme.  Taliban soldiers kept the crowd reasonably quiet, but people who were told they weren't eligible for a hand-out were angry and frightened.  ""The winter is nearly here,"" said one old man. ""I don't know how I'll get through it if I can't make bread.""The WFP is faced with having to raise its supplies to Afghanistan to help more than 22 million people. If the weather is as bad as experts are predicting this winter, the expectation is that large numbers will be threatened with acute hunger and widespread famine.  I spoke to the executive director of the WFP, David Beasley, when he paid a visit to Kabul on Sunday. His analysis of the situation was alarming.""It is as bad as you possibly can imagine,"" said Mr Beasley. ""In fact, we're now looking at the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth.""Ninety-five percent of the people don't have enough food, and now we're looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,"" he added. ""The next six months are going to be catastrophic. It is going to be hell on Earth.""Before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan in August, there was confidence that the government of President Ashraf Ghani would be able to cope with the threat of a bad winter, given the help of the international community. That help evaporated when Mr Ghani's government collapsed.  Western countries have cut off their aid to the country, since they don't want to be seen to help a regime which bars girls from education and is in favour of reintroducing the full range of sharia punishments.  But will those countries just stand by now and allow millions of innocent people to face acute hunger?  Mr Beasley challenges the governments and the billionaires of the developed world to face up to the urgent need for help.""To the world leaders, to the billionaires: imagine that this was your little girl or your little boy, or your grandchild about to starve to death,"" he said. ""You would do everything you possibly could, and when there's $400 trillion worth of wealth on the earth today, shame on us.""""We let any child die from hunger. Shame on us. I don't care where that child is,"" he adds.In the city of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan, where in 2001 the Taliban destroyed the ancient and beautiful statues of the Buddha, carved into the cliffside in the 6th Century, we went to meet a widow, Fatema, and her seven children aged from three to 16.  Her husband died of stomach cancer not long ago. They are wretchedly poor, and live in a cave close to the huge alcove in the cliff where one of the Buddhas used to stand.  Under the last government Fatema was able to get fairly regular supplies of flour and oil, but those stopped directly the Taliban took over.  Fatema used to make a little money weeding the soil for a nearby farmer. Now, though, the drought which has been afflicting this area means that fewer crops have survived, and there is no work for her.  ""I'm frightened,"" she says. ""I've got nothing to give the children. Soon I'll have to go out and beg.""Some parents have sold their daughters off to older men in marriage. Fatema has refused to do that. But unless the supply of food resumes, she and her children face actual starvation.  Now the snow is beginning to settle on the nearby mountain-tops and there is a new sharpness in the air.  The winter will very soon be here, and huge numbers of people like Fatema and her family will be on the very brink of catastrophe.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9F7B/production/_121472804_gettyimages-1232412981.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59202880,80,2021-11-08T06:40:54.000Z,politics

Beijing has been developing and testing anti-ship ballistic missiles for years.The US has warned that in recent months China has been rapidly expanding its military, including its nuclear capabilities, as tension builds in the South China Sea.On Sunday, USNI News said the structures photographed in the Taklamakan Desert appeared to include flat outlines of US military vessels without weapons or other details. It said the images showed mock-ups of an aircraft carrier and at least two US Navy destroyers. The site reported that the building of such structures ""shows that China continues to focus on anti-carrier capabilities, with an emphasis on US Navy warships"". Earlier this year, China was suspected of carrying out a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile test - missiles that can fly in the upper atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound - which prompted concern in Washington.Beijing later denied the reports and said it had been a routine spacecraft check.The US Navy regularly carries out what it describes as routine missions with military ships in the South China Sea, which is one of the most disputed regions in the world. China claims most of the region, but surrounding countries and the US disagree.The area is part of a major shipping route used to transport more than $3 trillion (£2.2 trillion) worth of trade annually.The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam have all been disputing China's claim to almost all of the Sea for decades, but tension has steadily increased in recent years.The US has backed many of these countries in this territorial dispute.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/180D6/production/_121481589_tv071839219.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59210417,80,2021-11-08T16:44:28.000Z,politics
82,Chennai rains: At least five dead after heavy downpour,"At least five people have died after heavy showers triggered severe flooding in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.The state's capital, Chennai, is severely affected as officials have evacuated hundreds of people from their homes.This is the heaviest rainfall in the city since 2015.Officials say more rain is expected in the next two days and it could trigger further flooding in low-lying areas. Local media footage showed uprooted trees and cars submerged as water quickly rose to block roads.Although Chennai is frequently hit with heavy rains this time of the year, experts say unchecked development and bad urban planning leads to the destruction and chaos. Climate change caused by global warming has also contributed to the problem, making extreme rainfall more likely and more frequent. Parts of Chennai has been facing power cuts as the power department shut off supply  to avoid incidents of electrocution. Footage showed people being rescued on rubber boats as muddy brown waters gushed into their homes. The National Disaster Response Force and the army are helping in the rescue work.Others were seen wading through knee-deep water to get essential commodities. Most of the main streets have been waterlogged since Saturday, bringing the city to a standstill. Several people on social media said the situation was as grim as the floods of 2015, when over 200 people had lost their lives in the state. All schools and colleges in Chennai and neighbouring districts have been shut and officials have advised against travelling in the hazardous conditions.

84,Zika virus: India's Kanpur city on alert after 89 cases reported,"At least 89 people, including 17 children, have tested positive for the Zika virus in a district in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh.Kanpur's chief medical officer, Dr Nepal Singh, told Reuters there has been a surge in cases in the district. India reported its first confirmed cases of the virus in Gujarat in 2017.The mosquito-borne virus has been linked to shrunken brains in children and a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome.Although the virus is mostly spread by mosquitoes, it can also be sexually transmitted.This is the first outbreak of the virus in Uttar Pradesh. The first case in Kanpur city was detected on 23 October and cases have since been on the rise, a state health official told Reuters. Among those who have tested positive is a pregnant woman. Mr Singh said that authorities had formed teams to increase surveillance of the outbreak and to contain its spread. Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath noted that the infection was ""spreading rapidly"" in the city and instructed officials to speed up sanitisation work, news agency ANI reported. ""Considering the seriousness, special caution is required. The health of each patient should be continuously monitored,"" he said. The virus was first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947.

85,Dug Dug: A film inspired by India's motorcycle god,"A new film, which is based on a bizarre story of a temple dedicated to a motorcycle deity, is creating a buzz in the international festival circuit, writes Faizal Khan. Modestly titled, Dug Dug, echoing the thumping sound of a Royal Enfield motorcycle first made in the English town of Redditch, Worcestershire, more than a century ago, the film has a fairy tale plot. An inebriated man driving a motorcycle on a highway is run over by a truck. Next morning, his vehicle disappears from police custody and mysteriously surfaces on the same spot where he had died. Hauled back to the police station, the motorcycle keeps returning to the roadside scene of the accident. A combination of village intrigue and superstition soon lifts the dead man into a saint and his motorcycle a deity in the desert state of Rajasthan. The Hindi language film is a scorching satire on the quirky rituals and commercialisation of religion. Narrated with simplicity, the film explores the drama and mystique that makes droves of unsuspecting people want to cling to their bizarre beliefs.""If you believe in something wholeheartedly, it works for you,"" said Ritwik Pareek, the director of Dug Dug, who was born in Jaipur, Rajasthan's capital.The 107-minute feature film, which had its premiere at the 46th Toronto International Film Festival last month, is inspired by a temple in Pali, about 75km (46 miles) from Jodhpur, a favourite destination with foreign tourists in the state.The deity of the roadside temple is an old Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle kept on a pedestal. The motorcycle belonged to local resident Om Singh Rathore who died in an accident on the highway connecting Jodhpur to Jaipur city more than three decades ago. The temple, popularly known as the ""Bullet Baba"" (Baba in Hindi means saint) temple, is a favourite spot for truck drivers on long hauls who stop at Pali to offer prayers to keep them safe on the country's tricky highways.  India tops the number of road-accident deaths in the world accounting for 11% of all such  fatalities around the world, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways that recorded 151,113 accident deaths in 2019 for which the latest data is available.""In India we have so many temples, one is more bizarre than the other,"" said Pareek, who quit his job as an art director in advertising in Mumbai six years ago to become a full-time filmmaker. And instead of staying in Mumbai, the seat of Bollywood, he returned home to Jaipur.One day he was reading The God Delusion, a 2006 book by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins questioning religious beliefs, when Pareek remembered the motorcycle deity in Jodhpur. ""The idea for Dug Dug was born there,"" he said. Pareek soon headed for the ""Bullet Baba' temple and several more across Rajasthan in the next five months for research.""I visited the temple in Pali as a kid. My family is very religious and my grandmother used to take me with her whenever she visited temples. She was very strict about rituals,"" said the filmmaker, who deputed his father to Jodhpur to talk to Rathore's family about making a movie. The family had two conditions -  don't use Rathore's real name and no mention of his caste.After he finished writing the script, Pareek auditioned over a hundred people, most of them non-professional actors from villages around Ramgarh, about 40km from Jaipur where the film is shot. A local man selected for playing Thakur Lal, the film's character based on Rathore, left the set saying he revered Rathore too much to play him. An old Luna, an Indian moped modelled on the Italian Piaggio vélo bike, replaced Rathore's Bullet motorcycle in the film.""This is our version of the Jodhpur temple story,"" said Prerna Ritwik, the director's sister and the film's producer about their first feature film. ""In India, almost everyone has a story from their childhood that involves a miracle,"" she added. ""It never pokes fun at anyone, instead shows you the power of belief,"" said Rohan Rajadhyaksha, a member of the Indian musical group Salvage Audio Collective, which composed the music for the film.The film and its makers are now waiting for another run on the international festival circuit. ""Every culture has aspects that may seem eccentric to another,"" said Peter Kuplowsky, the Toronto festival programmer who selected Dug Dug for its Discovery section that presents compelling and diverse stories from around the world every year.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1064F/production/_121215176_79baa427-a429-45f2-97e5-4d9c414c9feb.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59036542,80,2021-11-08T00:17:25.000Z,politics
86,Delhi pollution: Are Diwali fireworks to blame?,"Air pollution levels have shot up in the Indian capital, Delhi, during the current festive season of Diwali.A lot of attention has focused on the impact of fireworks and this year India's Supreme Court has recently allowed the use of green or eco-friendly crackers.But how far are fireworks responsible for poor air quality?There are studies which show that levels of some hazardous pollutants rise significantly during the Diwali period, but there are also other factors that could account for poor air quality.Air pollution has become an increasingly serious problem in Indian cities in recent years.Around 57,000 people died prematurely in Delhi in 2020 as a result of exposure to air pollution according to Greenpeace, despite the Covid lockdown. Twenty of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India according to a World Air Quality report for 2020, with the highest annual concentrations of PM2.5 - one of the most harmful particles for human health.The levels are way above the recommended WHO guidelines for concentrations of PM2.5.Around this time of year, Delhi and other cities in northern India, experience worsening air quality because of a combination of factors, not just because of Diwali fireworks.These include:Several states have banned the sale and use of fireworks during Diwali, but the implementation of the ban is weak in many states.A 2018 study that has attempted to answer this question says there is a ""small but statistically significant"" effect from Diwali fireworks.The study focused on five locations across Delhi, and looked at data gathered between 2013 and 2016.Diwali is set according to the Hindu lunar calendar and usually happens in late October or early November.The different dates are important because they enable the authors to take into account crop burning as a factor, because that starts at the same time of year.""We used Nasa satellite data to establish when crop burning was happening in northern India,"" Dhananjay Ghei, one of the authors of the report told the BBC.In two out of the four years, crop burning did not coincide directly with Diwali celebrations.And they also point out that industrial activity in one location stopped because of the holiday, and factored the weather conditions into their calculations.They found increases in concentrations of PM2.5 of almost 40% by the second day of the festival.This then falls back to existing background levels soon after the end of Diwali.And when looked at on an hourly basis, there was a rise of 100% for the five hours after 18:00 local time - the evening darkness period when most celebrations take place.A report by Centre for Science and Environment, a non-profit based in Delhi, showed that the concentration of PM2.5 rose during Diwali in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in the capital. Crop burning makes a significant contribution to poor air quality.The government's monitoring system shows that this year, it accounted for 48% of PM2.5 particles in Delhi by 7 November, before going down a bit.This was higher than the peaks recorded last year, and information from satellites that can detect active fires shows large parts of Punjab and Haryana states affected.It should also be pointed out that not all fireworks produce a lot of PM2.5 particles, although the bigger ones tend to have larger concentrations.But fireworks contain other toxic substances, including heavy metals. A separate study done in the Indian city of Jamshedpur found significantly increased levels of the following substances during the Diwali period:The government's own Central Pollution Control Board lists 15 substances in fireworks which it says are ""hazardous and toxic"".Again, it needs to be added that some of these substances can also be produced by vehicle emissions.Vehicle traffic does increase during Diwali when people go out to buy gifts and visit family and friends.However, there's very little research that quantifies its exact contribution to poor air quality in this period.This piece was first published in November 2018 and has been updated to reflect recent studies and pollution data.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/2781/production/_104231101_gettyimages-155696662.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46138064,80,2021-11-08T11:33:39.000Z,politics
87,"As winter looms, reports of starvation in North Korea","The warnings are stark and coming from inside and outside of North Korea. Defectors based in South Korea have told us that their families in the North are going hungry. There is a concern as winter approaches that the most vulnerable will starve.""Problems such as more orphan children on the streets and death by starvation are continuously being reported,"" said Lee Sang Yong, editor in chief of the Daily NK, which has sources in North Korea.""The lower classes in North Korea are suffering more and more,"" as food shortages are worse than expected, Mr Lee said.Getting information out of North Korea is increasingly difficult. The border has been closed since January last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China. Even getting messages out of the country to family and friends who have defected to South Korea comes at a huge risk. Anyone caught with an unauthorised mobile phone could be thrown into a labour camp. And yet some still try to send letters or voice mail via text to their loved ones and to publications in Seoul. Through these sources, some of which have to remain anonymous, we have tried to build a picture of what is going on.North Korea has always struggled with food shortages, but the pandemic has made a bad situation worse. Leader Kim Jong-un has compared the current situation to the country's worst disaster in the 1990's, known as the ""Arduous March"", where hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine.The situation is not thought to be that bad - yet. There are some hopeful signs. North Korea appears to be preparing to re-open the border with China, but it's unclear how much trade and aid will be needed to repair the economic damage already wrought on the impoverished country.This year's harvest is crucial. Last year's crops were partly destroyed by a series of typhoons. The United Nations estimates that the country is short of at least two to three months' supply of food.To ensure this year is as successful as possible, tens of thousands of people have been sent into the fields to help gather rice and corn, including the army. Kim Jong-un has also reportedly ordered that every grain of rice in the country is to be secured and that everyone who eats should go and help with the harvest.""A plan has been devised to minimise losses in the harvesting process,"" said Mr Lee, from the Daily NK. ""It emphasises that strict punishment will be imposed if theft or cheating is reported. It's creating an atmosphere of fear.""Last week, South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) told a closed-door parliamentary hearing that Mr Kim said he felt he was ""walking on thin ice due to the economic situation"", according to lawmakers at the briefing. The NIS also reportedly said the lack of medicine and essential supplies has accelerated the spread of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever.This growing concern has been amplified by state media, which has highlighted measures being taken to prevent crop damage and released propaganda posters emphasising efforts to work on food production.North Korea is facing two major issues with its food supply. The first is its farming methods. Pyongyang may have invested in new military technology and missiles, but it lacks the modern machinery needed for a speedy and successful harvest, according to experts.Choi Yongho from the Korean Rural Economic Institute told us that ""the insufficient supply of agricultural equipment results in low food productivity"".We managed to see this for ourselves.From a new lookout point in the western tip of South Korea, with the affluent skyscrapers of Seoul as a backdrop, my team and I got a good view over the Han River into North Korea. It feels so close - and yet so far.I heard one young girl remark through her binoculars that they were the ""same people"". ""They're just like us"", she said, as she bounced back to her mum.The villagers, dozens of them, were busy creating bails of rice and carrying them on their backs to a rather run-down tractor. A South Korean farmer in Paju, near the demilitarised zone which separates the two countries, said it took him an hour to strip his fields of rice with a machine. If he'd done it by hand, as it's done in the North, he said one field would take him a week.But along with the lack of technology and farming supplies, North Korea is facing a much longer-term problem if it wants to secure its food supply.The country has been listed by US intelligence agencies as one of 11 countries most vulnerable to the effects of global warming, and the limited area it has to grow crops could be the hardest hit.""Rice and maize yield failures will become more likely along the Western coastline, which is North Korea's historical breadbasket,"" said Catherine Dill, from the Council on Strategic Risks - one of the authors of a recent report on 'Converging Crises in North Korea'. That may explain why Pyongyang sent its UK ambassador to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.""North Korea is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. Flood, monsoon rains and typhoons trouble them every year which directly affect yield and indirectly cause pest problems,"" said Mr Choi.The 'Converging Crises' report suggests this will get much worse in years to come and rice production in particular will be affected by droughts and flooding.""More intense storms already appear to be affecting North Korea, there are really prominent examples of this in both the 2020 and 2021 typhoon seasons. And in terms of sea level rise, coastal areas are going to be increasingly at risk,"" Ms Dill said.While Pyongyang rarely engages with the outside world, it has often made an exception for climate change and the environment.North Korea worked with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on detailed country reports in 2003 and 2012, and is also a signatory to international treaties including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.One reason for this engagement on climate change may be its impact on food production. The 2012 UNEP report noted that the average temperature in North Korea increased by 1.9°C between 1918 and 2000, among Asia's fastest warming rates.According to a 2019 Green Climate Fund report, annual average temperatures in North Korea are further expected to rise by 2.8-4.7°C by the 2050's.South Korea sees a chance here to work together on a problem that affects them both.Seoul's Environment Minister Han Jeoung-ae told me last week that she hoped to meet her counterpart in Glasgow to talk about inter-Korean collaboration on climate change but that hasn't happened. If the North Korean delegation is listening to the speeches in Scotland they will know that even when the fear of this pandemic eases and trade with China resumes, even when goods once again start to flow over the border, the country faces a growing crisis which will profoundly affect an already vulnerable population. And it cannot overcome this on its own.Additional reporting by Shreyas Reddy of BBC Monitoring.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A69F/production/_121355624_gettyimages-668755738.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59144712,80,2021-11-05T01:13:40.000Z,politics
88,T20 World Cup: When Indian fans are jailed for celebrating Pakistan's win,"Like millions of others around the world, Nafeesa Attari was glued to her screen as India played Pakistan in their opening match of the T20 World Cup. The schoolteacher from the northern Indian city of Udaipur watched as Pakistan won the match by 10 wickets in what was a clinical and emphatic win. Days later she was arrested and held in a police cell. Her apparent crime: her WhatsApp status celebrating Pakistan's victory. She is among several Muslims in India who have been arrested or detained for supporting Pakistan in the recent match - raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the world's largest democracy. Observers argue that these arrests are the latest weapon in the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) agenda to target Muslim minorities, a charge the government strongly denies. ""Jeeeet gayeeee… We wonnn,"" Ms Attari wrote, over an image of some of the team's players in her WhatsApp status.Her post was spotted by one of her students' parents, who sent it to others before it went viral on the messaging service. Ms Attari was fired from her teaching job, and arrested under a section of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises ""assertions prejudicial to national integration"".In an interview with a local TV channel, she appeared visibly distressed as she apologised for causing offence.""Someone messaged me [replying to my status] and asked if I was supporting Pakistan. As the message had emojis and there was a playful atmosphere, I said yes"", she said.""This doesn't mean I support Pakistan. I am an Indian, I love India.""Having secured bail, she is back home with her husband and young child, and is fighting the charges. ""What the police have done is absolutely wrong. If someone makes a mistake or if you don't agree with someone, that's not a crime or anti-national"", her lawyer Rajesh Singhvi said. ""This is against the constitution and our laws.""Rajendra Parmar, a member of the hardline Hindu nationalist group Bajrang Dal, had reported Ms Attari to the police. ""These people should go to Pakistan. You're living in India, earning here but you're celebrating their win,"" he told the BBC. Mr Parmar said he had no regrets about making the complaint. ""This should be a [lesson] for her. She's a teacher in a school. What kind of education will she give those children?""His comments cut deep into the visceral hostility many in India and Pakistan feel towards each other, ever since the two nations were created after the partition of British India in 1947. And relations are particularly tense in  Indian-administered Kashmir, where an insurgency against Indian rule has been under way since the late 1980s.A group of medical students in Kashmir have also been charged - under a strict anti-terror law - for allegedly rooting for the Pakistani cricket team. In a video which has surfaced online, a man, allegedly former BJP lawmaker Vikram Randhawa, can be heard saying the students should be ""skinned alive"" and have their degrees and citizenship cancelled for raising pro-Pakistan slogans on Indian soil. Mr Randhawa has been charged by police for hate speech, and has been reprimanded by the BJP, which has asked him to apologise within 48 hours for these remarks.  While the party is distancing itself from the use of such severe language, other senior members of the BJP have condemned those supporting Pakistan, with some saying it should be considered a crime. Former Indian cricketer turned BJP politician Gautam Gambhir said anyone who celebrated Pakistan's win was ""shameful"".  ""Those bursting crackers on Pak winning can't be Indian! We stand by our boys,"" he wrote on Twitter.Yogi Adityanath, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and chief minister of the country's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, told a newspaper that Indians who cheered the victory should be charged with sedition.India's colonial era sedition law criminalises criticism of the government. Many say it's increasingly being used to stifle free speech.""What we're seeing here is part of a political process of the BJP consolidating the Hindu vote by 'otherising' Muslims,"" said Amit Varma, host of the podcast The Seen and the Unseen.""They've weaponised issues that have been dormant in our politics for decades: cow slaughter, Hindu-Muslim marriages, and even Indians supporting Pakistan.""""None of these have any substance to them. They are just issues to whip up anti-Muslim passions which, sadly seem to be widespread,"" he argued.But a senior Indian government spokesperson said it was ""preposterous"" for anyone to say that taking action against a very small number of Muslims amounted to penalising the millions of people who belong to the faith in the country.  ""They [those arrested] were celebrating India's defeat… every such act has the potential of setting into motion a 'law and order situation', so that has to be prevented by all means,"" Kanchan Gupta, senior adviser to the ministry of information and broadcasting, told the BBC as he defended the arrests. ""If two students here, five students there, or a teacher somewhere decides to do something which is provocative and has the potential to instigate further problems, that needs to be checked… and investigated"" he added. The families of many who are being held believe the actions are wholly disproportionate. Seven people in Uttar Pradesh were also accused of celebrating Pakistan's win. Police said they had used disrespectful words and anti-national comments against the Indian cricket team to disturb the peace. Three of them - Arshad Yousef, Inayat Altaf and Shaukat Ahmad, all engineering students at a college in Agra - are in jail. The men, who have been suspended from their college, struggled to find a lawyer.""We are not going to provide any legal assistance to these students as they were celebrating Pakistan's victory while living in India,"" said Nitin Verma, president of the Young Lawyers' Association in the city. ""This is against our country and anti-national. It is our duty to oppose them, so such acts are not encouraged in the future.""This isn't the first time a cricket match has provoked such a strong response. In 2014, 60 Kashmiri students in Uttar Pradesh were charged with sedition for cheering Pakistan against India. But the charges were later dropped following legal advice from the law ministry.Cricket has always been a big part of the Indian psyche, but a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that a slim majority of adults in the country (56%) felt it was important to support India's cricket team to be truly Indian. ""When in the law is it a crime to support an opposition cricket team?"" asks Sharda Ugra, a cricket journalist and social commentator. ""Should people of Indian origin in the UK or Australia be arrested for supporting India? It's obviously a deliberate religious divide that's being provoked on both sides.""There are also examples of similar incidents on the other side of the border.In 2016, a Pakistani fan of India's cricket captain, Virat Kohli, was arrested after hoisting the Indian flag as a tribute to him. When it comes to cricket, passions run high in both nations, but these latest arrests in India have come as a shock to many who feel that the space for freedom of expression is shrinking fast.

92,REvil: Day of reckoning for notorious cyber gang,"A global police operation has dealt a devastating blow to one of the most prolific cyber-crime gangs in history.The co-ordinated action against the REvil gang was announced on Monday by Romanian police, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Europol.The raids, which took place both on and offline, led to the arrests of two alleged hackers in Romania and one from Ukraine. REvil has been blamed for major hacks on global businesses in recent years. The US also announced that it had successfully retrieved more than $6m (£4m) in cryptocurrency from the gang in a so-called ""claw back"" hacking operation.For the last three years REvil - which used to call itself GandCrab and is also known as Sodinikobi - has been attacking businesses and institutions around the world.Europol's operation, named GoldDust, was set up specifically to tackle the group. Since February the operation has led to 7 arrests of the hacker gang in total in Romania, Ukraine, South Korea and Kuwait.Officers allege that the two Romanians arrested on November 4th infected 5,000 victims and pocketed half a million euros in ransom payments.In recent weeks the leaders of REvil announced that pressure from authorities had forced them to shut down operations.Back in May, REvil's ransomware targeted the world's largest meat processor, JBS SA, disrupting meat production for several days. The company ultimately paid $11m to the hackers. The group's malware also caused months of disruption to foreign exchange company Travelex, which had all computer systems offline for weeks.Most recently, the gang successfully hacked Florida-based software firm Kaseya which subsequently infected up to 1,500 businesses around the world.The US Treasury Department said more than $200m in ransom payments were paid in Bitcoin and Monero in the attack.The DOJ says Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, a Ukrainian man arrested in Poland last month, was responsible and has indicted him. The US is seeking to extradite him for trial in America.Another alleged REvil operative, Russian Yevgeniy Polyanin, 28, has also been charged by the US with conspiracy to commit fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other charges.Russia is unlikely to extradite its own citizen to the US, so Mr Polyanin is expected to join a growing list of wanted alleged Russian hackers.The Treasury Department added that the two men face sanctions for their alleged role in ransomware incidents in the United States.Court documents also accused a virtual cryptocurrency exchange called Chatex of ""facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors"".FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters on Monday: ""The long arm of the law reaches a lot further than they think.'The cyber threat is daunting, but when we combine the right people, the right tools and the right authority, our adversaries are no match for what we can accomplish together.""Good news is rare in cyber-security, especially in the last 18 months when the surge in ransomware attacks has targeted everything from public institutions to schools and hospitals.But this is unequivocally great news.REvil was probably the most prolific and dangerous cyber-crime gang ever and they've operated with complete confidence and arrogance.Not only were their attacks indiscriminate, they had a website they sarcastically called their ""Happy Blog"" where they would name and shame victims who didn't pay their ransoms.They even had a live chat portal and were happy to brag about their work to reporters like me.This multinational police operation is extremely impressive in its coordination and aggression and shows just what can be done to attack these cyber-criminals on all fronts.This is probably the end of REvil, and along with other recent success stories, it feels like a turning point in the fight against ransomware.But with many of the criminal gangs thought to be operating in Russia immune from prosecution, it likely won't be the end just yet.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15CA0/production/_121484298_europolpic.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59215167,80,2021-11-08T20:36:33.000Z,technology
93,Thousands of phone boxes to be saved from closure,"Thousands of phone boxes around the UK will be protected from closure.Ofcom, the UK telecoms regulator, said it will stop BT from closing down 5,000 phone boxes in areas with poor mobile signals or high accident rates, if they are still needed by local communities. The watchdog said that without such protection, some - which are considered ""vital"" - would still have been closed.For the past few years BT has been decommissioning unused payphones.Now a phone box will be saved if:At their peak, there were around 92,000 phone boxes in the UK, but now 96% of UK adults own a mobile phone.About 6,000 of the kiosks have been adopted by local authorities for other purposes, such as book exchanges. Now, if no payphone is needed, communities will be able to purchase them for £1 and use them for other purposes.Selina Chadha, Ofcom's Director of Connectivity, said: ""Some of the call boxes we plan to protect are used to make relatively low numbers of calls. But if one of those calls is from a distressed child, an accident victim or someone contemplating suicide, that public phone line can be a lifeline at a time of great need.  ""We also want to make sure that people without mobile coverage, often in rural areas, can still make calls. At the same time, we're planning to support the rollout of new phone boxes with free Wi-Fi and charging. ""Under our plans, BT and KCOM - which operates Hull's unique white phone boxes - must also install batteries in some payphones, so they can still be used during a power cut.""There are currently about 21,000 call boxes across the country. For people without a mobile, or for those in areas with poor mobile coverage, these can be a lifeline for making calls to friends and family, helpline services and accessing emergency services. Almost 150,000 calls were made to emergency services from phone boxes in the year to May 2020, while 25,000 calls were made to Childline, and 20,000 to the Samaritans.

94,Twitter poll calls on Elon Musk to sell 10% stake in Tesla,"Voters in a Twitter poll have urged Elon Musk to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla in order to pay tax.More than 3.5 million Twitter users voted in the poll, launched by Mr Musk on Saturday, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale.The vote could see him dispose of nearly $21bn (£16bn) of stock in the electric carmaker.He has promised to abide by the result, in response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats.But Mr Musk, one of the world's richest men, has yet to comment publicly on the verdict, or how and when he would sell his stake.Should he go ahead with the sale, it could leave him with a huge tax bill.When disposing of large share holdings, some chief executives use so-called ""blind"" sales programmes, spreading the sale over a long time period to avoid accusations of insider trading.In an earlier tweet on Saturday, Mr Musk said he took no salary or bonuses from any of his companies - meaning he has no earnings on which to pay income tax.But he has made billions of dollars through a compensation package, which gives him power to exercise large amounts of stock options when the company meets performance targets and its shares hit certain prices.Mr Musk has an option, which expires in August next year, to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each - a fraction of Tesla's closing share price on Friday of $1,222.Under plans proposed by the Democratic Party in the Senate, billionaires could be taxed on ""unrealised gains"" when the price of their shares goes up - even if they do not sell any of their stock.It is thought the proposed tax on capital gains, whether or not assets have been sold, could hit about 700 billionaires in the US. Critics have pointed out that the value of assets do not always go up.Mr Musk's recent Twitter poll has raised some eyebrows in the world of finance. ""We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,"" Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter.""Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,"" Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted.   Mr Musk is one of the most popular business leaders on Twitter, with nearly 63 million followers.He regularly uses the platform to share updates from the companies he owns - including SpaceX and Neuralink. He is also known for sharing memes, adding to his popularity among fans.But some posts have drawn controversy.Earlier this year he tweeted in response to a claim, made by the head of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), that just 2% of Mr Musk's wealth could help to solve world hunger. In October, Mr Musk said he would sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to the WFP, provided it could describe ""exactly how $6bn will solve world hunger"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9A15/production/_121454493_e5f7d615-55f8-4b76-bc3c-b506b5fdde70.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59182278,80,2021-11-07T22:06:09.000Z,technology
95,TikTok: Missing girl found after using viral call for help sign,"A teenager who went missing in the US has been found after she used hand signals that went viral on TikTok to show she was in danger.The girl had been reported missing by her parents in North Carolina on Tuesday morning, and was spotted inside a car in Kentucky two days later.The 16-year-old used the gesture designed to help domestic abuse victims ask for help to alert a passing driver.Authorities say they arrested a 61-year-old man.A driver called police after noticing ""a female passenger in the vehicle making hand gestures that are known on the social media platform TikTok to represent violence at home - I need help - domestic violence,"" the Laurel County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.The caller noted that the girl ""appeared to be in distress"" and was being driven by an older male.The girl, who has not been named, told officers she had travelled through North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio.Police later arrested James Herbert Brick, 61, of Cherokee, North Carolina, while he was driving near a Kentucky interstate on Thursday afternoon.The hand gesture is a one-handed sign someone can use when in distress, according to the Canadian Women's Foundation. The victim holds up their hand with their palm facing out, then tucks their thumb into their hand before closing their fingers on top of the thumb.The campaign, called the ""signal for help"", spread across social media in 2020 during the initial pandemic lockdowns, in an attempt to address a rise in domestic violence.The idea was a way for domestic abuse victims to seek help using a non-verbal cue. Videos demonstrating the signs also gained momentum in the UK in the aftermath of the murder of Sarah Everard, which sparked a debate over women's safety.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F72D/production/_121477236_gettyimages-1235604538-594x594.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59206549,80,2021-11-08T13:29:37.000Z,technology
96,Fishing gear seller caught in hacker's net,"The UK's biggest fishing shop has been hacked, with its website redirecting keen anglers to an adult website.Angling Direct, which sells fishing gear online and through stores, said it was hit by the attack late on Friday.On top of the website redirect, its Twitter account has been compromised to also reference a porn site and to post contact details for the attacker.The company said it has brought in cyber-security experts to tackle the problem, and alerted authorities.On Angling Direct's own Twitter account, the attacker posted a mocking tweet claiming the company had been sold to adult website Pornhub. ""Your data has already been transferred"" to the adult video empire, it told fishing enthusiasts, apparently trolling them.But Angling Direct said it is not clear if any personal data has been compromised - and that no payment data could be.The attacker also posted an email address where they could be reached, along with an offer to return ""information and access"" to the site. No public demands for ransom were made. Fishing (or phishing) puns aside, this case will send shivers down the spines of company bosses.Yes, this attack carries all the hallmarks of an immature teenage hacker having fun but it is no doubt causing serious problems for the victim.Experts tell me that signs point to employee login credentials having been stolen, allowing the hackers to take over the website and, separately, the Twitter account of the company.The motive is clear - the hackers want to be paid before they hand back control to the firm.But in the meantime the company is losing money from potential sales - not to mention trust and reputational damage, as customers are left embarrassed or worse when accidentally visiting an explicit site.In a statement, the company said: ""We are mindful of our obligations regarding data; it is too soon yet to make any determination around the impact this incident has had on personal data.""""Importantly, the company does not hold any customer financial data, as our website transactions are handled by third parties.""Angling Direct's several dozen physical shops remain open for in-store purchases, according to a post by one of the locations on Facebook.The firm has also posted messages to the Facebook page of at least one local store, apologising to anyone who was ""directed away from our site and towards inappropriate content"".

99,REvil: Day of reckoning for notorious cyber gang,"A global police operation has dealt a devastating blow to one of the most prolific cyber-crime gangs in history.The co-ordinated action against the REvil gang was announced on Monday by Romanian police, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Europol.The raids, which took place both on and offline, led to the arrests of two alleged hackers in Romania and one from Ukraine. REvil has been blamed for major hacks on global businesses in recent years. The US also announced that it had successfully retrieved more than $6m (£4m) in cryptocurrency from the gang in a so-called ""claw back"" hacking operation.For the last three years REvil - which used to call itself GandCrab and is also known as Sodinikobi - has been attacking businesses and institutions around the world.Europol's operation, named GoldDust, was set up specifically to tackle the group. Since February the operation has led to 7 arrests of the hacker gang in total in Romania, Ukraine, South Korea and Kuwait.Officers allege that the two Romanians arrested on November 4th infected 5,000 victims and pocketed half a million euros in ransom payments.In recent weeks the leaders of REvil announced that pressure from authorities had forced them to shut down operations.Back in May, REvil's ransomware targeted the world's largest meat processor, JBS SA, disrupting meat production for several days. The company ultimately paid $11m to the hackers. The group's malware also caused months of disruption to foreign exchange company Travelex, which had all computer systems offline for weeks.Most recently, the gang successfully hacked Florida-based software firm Kaseya which subsequently infected up to 1,500 businesses around the world.The US Treasury Department said more than $200m in ransom payments were paid in Bitcoin and Monero in the attack.The DOJ says Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, a Ukrainian man arrested in Poland last month, was responsible and has indicted him. The US is seeking to extradite him for trial in America.Another alleged REvil operative, Russian Yevgeniy Polyanin, 28, has also been charged by the US with conspiracy to commit fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other charges.Russia is unlikely to extradite its own citizen to the US, so Mr Polyanin is expected to join a growing list of wanted alleged Russian hackers.The Treasury Department added that the two men face sanctions for their alleged role in ransomware incidents in the United States.Court documents also accused a virtual cryptocurrency exchange called Chatex of ""facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors"".FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters on Monday: ""The long arm of the law reaches a lot further than they think.'The cyber threat is daunting, but when we combine the right people, the right tools and the right authority, our adversaries are no match for what we can accomplish together.""Good news is rare in cyber-security, especially in the last 18 months when the surge in ransomware attacks has targeted everything from public institutions to schools and hospitals.But this is unequivocally great news.REvil was probably the most prolific and dangerous cyber-crime gang ever and they've operated with complete confidence and arrogance.Not only were their attacks indiscriminate, they had a website they sarcastically called their ""Happy Blog"" where they would name and shame victims who didn't pay their ransoms.They even had a live chat portal and were happy to brag about their work to reporters like me.This multinational police operation is extremely impressive in its coordination and aggression and shows just what can be done to attack these cyber-criminals on all fronts.This is probably the end of REvil, and along with other recent success stories, it feels like a turning point in the fight against ransomware.But with many of the criminal gangs thought to be operating in Russia immune from prosecution, it likely won't be the end just yet.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15CA0/production/_121484298_europolpic.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59215167,80,2021-11-08T20:36:33.000Z,technology

101,Twitter poll calls on Elon Musk to sell 10% stake in Tesla,"Voters in a Twitter poll have urged Elon Musk to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla in order to pay tax.More than 3.5 million Twitter users voted in the poll, launched by Mr Musk on Saturday, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale.The vote could see him dispose of nearly $21bn (£16bn) of stock in the electric carmaker.He has promised to abide by the result, in response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats.But Mr Musk, one of the world's richest men, has yet to comment publicly on the verdict, or how and when he would sell his stake.Should he go ahead with the sale, it could leave him with a huge tax bill.When disposing of large share holdings, some chief executives use so-called ""blind"" sales programmes, spreading the sale over a long time period to avoid accusations of insider trading.In an earlier tweet on Saturday, Mr Musk said he took no salary or bonuses from any of his companies - meaning he has no earnings on which to pay income tax.But he has made billions of dollars through a compensation package, which gives him power to exercise large amounts of stock options when the company meets performance targets and its shares hit certain prices.Mr Musk has an option, which expires in August next year, to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each - a fraction of Tesla's closing share price on Friday of $1,222.Under plans proposed by the Democratic Party in the Senate, billionaires could be taxed on ""unrealised gains"" when the price of their shares goes up - even if they do not sell any of their stock.It is thought the proposed tax on capital gains, whether or not assets have been sold, could hit about 700 billionaires in the US. Critics have pointed out that the value of assets do not always go up.Mr Musk's recent Twitter poll has raised some eyebrows in the world of finance.

The victim holds up their hand with their palm facing out, then tucks their thumb into their hand before closing their fingers on top of the thumb.The campaign, called the ""signal for help"", spread across social media in 2020 during the initial pandemic lockdowns, in an attempt to address a rise in domestic violence.The idea was a way for domestic abuse victims to seek help using a non-verbal cue.

The 29-year-old from South Wales, makes a living from the platform, and has built a community for trans people to connect online.But she has received abuse for the way she looks. ""Instagram is the biggest blessing and biggest curse of my life"", Dani tells the BBC.""When you're a trans person with an account that isn't private, it opens you up to abuse anyway - but some of the hate I've had online has been soul-destroying.""The hateful comments were vile. Someone even sent me a thread where people had taken images of me and were ridiculing me.""Frances Haugen told a joint committee of MPs and Lords that Instagram is about ""social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids.""Dani, who has beaten an alcohol addiction, says she can see how social media can feel addictive. ""I've been sober for a few years now, but I feel Instagram is bad for people with addictive personalities. It's the same feeling you get, the need to have more and more.""Sir Nick Clegg, vice-president of global affairs at Instagram's parent company Meta, has defended the platform, saying that the ""overwhelming majority"" of teenage girls enjoy using it.He said the company would be introducing tools to tackle harmful use of Instagram, including a nudge feature called ""take a break"", which will prompt young users to log off.Hannah spends six to 10 hours a day on social media, which she has had access to since she was a teenager. The 24-year-old, who is studying at the University of the West of Scotland in Ayr, has an account on all the major platforms; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok.""I have got this really bad habit of first thing in the morning checking all my notifications,"" she explains.""It's the last thing I check before I go to sleep. My whole day revolves around my social media. ""I'm definitely addicted to TikTok, I can easily scroll through for a couple of hours at a time. I know I am basically wasting time... there are times when I try and limit it.""On Instagram, Hannah used to follow influencers who made her feel bad about her body image.""It got me thinking that my body needed to look like theirs, and I began to have unrealistic expectations of being a slim model. I found it was really damaging my mental health, so I took a step back and unfollowed them.""Now she has changed who she follows, swapping influencers for body-positive accounts.""I realised not everyone is a size six, super skinny, six-foot model. I've started to follow people who look more like me, and that's improved my body confidence.""Hannah has received some hateful comments on Instagram.""I got comments from some people telling me I need to lose weight because I'm getting too fat - and I'm only a size ten. It made me feel negative about my body.""At Hornsey School for Girls in North London, Scarlett and Anisa tell the BBC they are aware of the dangers of social media.Scarlett is 15 and uses all the platforms except Facebook, which she does not think is for people her age.""I follow YouTubers that create content about fashion, like Emma Chamberlain, who I love,"" she says.""But when I see someone of a really high beauty standard when I've just finished going through puberty, it's really difficult because seeing that makes me think I should look like that. It has made me feel insecure.""I've unfollowed a lot of accounts.""Anisa, who is also 15, changes the accounts she follows, to try to avoid negative content.But she has still seen things online that she did not want to see.""I've noticed some people's accounts create a toxic environment. Because I'm a teen, I know I need to watch out for brainwashing,"" says Anisa.""As a Muslim, I feel like there is really bad representation of us... so if I see that type of content I unfollow.""The girls say they have also had enjoyable experiences on social media, especially when it comes to making videos with their friends. Scarlett says; ""I've tried a lot of cooking video recipes and I've learned a lot of skills from videos online. ""There are also accounts with amazing facts on there, and tips and tricks and life advice - it's not all bad, although the negatives probably outweigh the positives.""Not everyone at the school is on Instagram. Leah, who is 15, has not been allowed to set up an account yet. ""It's because of all the negative things that are out there, so I trust my mum's decision,"" she says.""I would quite like to have social media, because all my friends have it and I sometimes I feel out of the loop, but I know the bad side to it too. I have heard a lot of stories about my friends receiving inappropriate pictures and horrible videos - stuff people our age shouldn't be watching.""In September, Meta - then still called Facebook - paused plans to make an ""Instagram experience"" for under-13s, dubbed ""Instagram Kids"".The company said it would take time to listen to ""parents, experts, policymakers and regulators"", Instagram head Adam Mosseri said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E3E9/production/_121454385_070998013-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59180946,80,2021-11-07T00:18:30.000Z,technology
111,US offers $10m bounty for Colonial Pipeline hackers,"The United States government has offered a bounty of up to $10million (£7.4m) for information about the hacking group known as DarkSide.In May, a DarkSide ransomware attack shut down a vital 5,500-mile-long fuel pipeline on the east coast of the US.The pipeline carries 45% of the fuel used on the east coast.The bounty is offered for information which can lead to the ""identification or location of any individuals"" in a leadership position with DarkSide.A separate $5m reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of anybody ""conspiring to participate"" in a DarkSide ransomware attack.The cyber-attack caused fuel shortages after the Colonial Pipeline company shut down its operations for several days.It eventually paid the $4.4m ransom in Bitcoin.Crypto-currency analysis company Elliptic estimated that DarkSide had received at least $90m in ransom payments from 47 victims.However, US authorities later said 63.7 Bitcoin, the majority of the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, had been recovered.$10m is the largest bounty ever offered for the arrest of a specific cyber-criminal.The ignominious record was previously held by Maksim Yakubets, the alleged mastermind behind another ransomware gang called Evil Corp.The US named and shamed him (along with help from the UK authorities) in 2019.Before that, the record bounty stood at $3m for another alleged cyber-crime boss called Evgeniy Bogachev.The thing these individuals have in common?They are thought to be living care-free lives in Russia safe from any prospect of arrest from the local police, who routinely ignore western accusations against Russian hackers.Even with their names, pictures and a rough location published by the US, these alleged criminals are safe.The US seems to have even less to go on in terms of unmasking DarkSide's leaders, although most research suggests they are also in Russia.So, despite the eye-watering sums being offered by the US, the chances of these criminals facing justice are slim.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86FA/production/_121445543_mediaitem121445542.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59176826,80,2021-11-05T12:05:20.000Z,technology
112,Zuckerberg's metaverse: Lessons from Second Life,"This week, I travelled back in time to visit the future.It has been about 10 years since I first entered the virtual world of Second Life, arguably the internet's first attempt at what every tech giant is now racing to build: the so-called metaverse.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science-fiction novel, Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality successor to the internet, where people live large portions of their lives in virtual environments. Second Life peaked in the late 2000s with millions of users and hundreds of excitable headlines about people devoting hours of their daily lives to live digitally.Since then, I assumed it had died a slow and quiet death. But how wrong I was. The platform seems to have a small, loyal and potentially growing community of ""residents"", as they call themselves, logging on to experience what our metaverse future could look like.So for this week's Tech Tent podcast, I dipped back in.In terms of visuals, it is far from groundbreaking. It is more akin to the blocky and pixelated world of Roblox than a blockbuster game built around gorgeous immersive environments.But the difference here, of course, is that, like Mark Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse, Second Life is not a game. There are no gaming challenges or quests or storylines. It is just a place to hang out.One resident I met was Rei. Our avatars bumped into each other after teleporting to a seaside world modelled on a strange rundown 1960s Scottish fishing village. He told me he had been spending time in Second Life for about four months after ""getting curious about all this metaverse stuff"". Rei is not a fan of Zuckerberg's vision of the metaverse. ""They'll want to control everything. But I think the people should be in charge and it should be fully open,"" he told me. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of the newly renamed company Meta, addressed these concerns when he announced his grand plans. ""It's a future that is beyond any one company. That will be made by all of us,"" he said in his Facebook Connect keynote.Other large corporations, including Microsoft, Epic Games, Roblox and even Nike have announced plans to enter the metaverse in some form.Rei's concern about a metaverse monopoly is one shared by many, including Anya Kanevsky, vice-president of product management at Linden Lab - the company running Second Life. Anya has watched with interest as several tech giants have started to talk about the new idea of a life online. Second Life has been going since 2003.""I'm a little bit concerned about the dystopian nature that the conversation seems to be taking on right now,"" she says.""The entry of a slightly oversized and outsized player into the space seems to signal to people that they are not the owners of it, that someone else is going to be setting the rules and kind of running the show and they will just be the consumers.""Second Life, then, is much like Roblox - a place where users build environments and invite others to play - although it has far fewer participants. Roblox's record for concurrent players is estimated to be around 5.5m compared with Second Life's 90,000.Mark Zuckerberg says he, too, wants to put a community of users at the heart of his metaverse but he does not have any residents yet. Instead, he has pledged to take on 10,000 employees across Europe to build his worlds.Some argue that it's not even about allowing users more control: a metaverse should be built entirely by communities. John Carmack, the consulting chief technology officer of Oculus, Meta's virtual-reality headset division, believes that setting out to build a metaverse ""is not actually the best way to wind up with the metaverse"". As reported by Ars Technica, he said: ""I doubt a single application will get to that level of taking over everything. I just don't believe that one player - one company - winds up making all the right decisions for this.""Second Life's story also has more lessons to teach Mr Zuckerberg and others. At its peak, the site attracted negative headlines after high-profile virtual riots, Ponzi schemes based on the in-game currency and even issues around child grooming.Even in my short exploration this week, I caught glimpses of the moderation challenges that Second Life faces. Those would be amplified if a metaverse went mainstream.Searching for events or places with certain keywords such as ""porn"" or ""drugs"" is blocked.However, searching for ""sex"" took me to virtual strip clubs where I was offered digital lap dances in exchange for in-world money.""The approach to governance in a virtual world is complex,"" says Ms Kanevsky. ""Some of it can be automated away but a lot of it must have the human touch. It's not all just escapist behaviour and pretty dresses and gorgeous avatars.""Back in Second Life, I asked Rei one last question before I logged off: why does he keep coming back? He answered: ""I like to dream with my eyes"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/892B/production/_121451153_63b88357-eaec-4ba7-a773-22a929e844f5.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59180273,80,2021-11-05T14:59:40.000Z,technology
113,Facebook's metaverse plans labelled as 'dystopian' and 'a bad idea',"One of Facebook's earliest investors has labelled the social media giant's plans for a metaverse as ""dystopian"".Meta, as Facebook is now known, is investing billions in the project.But Roger McNamee told the BBC: ""It's a bad idea and the fact we are all sitting and looking at this like it's normal should be alarming everyone.""Meta's chief product officer Chris Cox told attendees at the Web Summit in Lisbon that the idea would make ""the internet less flat"".He said it would be considerably better than video conferencing as a space for meetings.However, speaking at the same event, Mr McNamee was highly sceptical.""Facebook should not be allowed to create a dystopian metaverse,"" he said.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science fiction novel Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual reality successor to the internet.Mr McNamee became a critic of Facebook as he began to see more misinformation on the platform. He said he was not convinced the metaverse would be safe in chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's hands.""There's no way that a regulator or policymaker should be allowing Facebook to operate there [in the metaverse] or get into cryptocurrencies,"" he said.""Facebook should have lost the right to make its own choices. A regulator should be there giving pre-approval for everything they do. The amount of harm they've done is incalculable.""Mr Cox, speaking for Meta, put forward a different view - that the metaverse idea is the next step for the internet as a whole, not just for his company.""Technology often starts in lower resolutions versions of what it becomes,"" he said.Feedback from Meta's Oculus virtual reality headset users was that the technology, which was improving all the time, could be ""incredibly fun"".Mr Cox told Nicholas Carlson, editor-in-chief of news publication Insider, that his own dabbling in the metaverse included hosting meetings and entertainment for staff.He said he and his wife had watched a comedy show with Facebook employees in which everyone appeared as avatars: ""Twenty of us in the room, co-workers, all laughing together.""That same technology was a good alternative to video calls, he argued.""Everyone is exhausted by video conferencing. You don't know who is looking at who, everyone is constantly interrupting each other.""Meetings in the metaverse would be far better, he said, with Meta working on how to improve ""spatial audio and body language"" in virtual reality.When asked why anyone would want to meet in virtual reality, he said: ""It will not replace real life - nothing should - and I don't want to design something that does.""He acknowledged that no one company, such as Meta, would own the metaverse, pointing to Roblox as an example.Roblox, a user-generated gaming platform valued at $30bn (£22bn) and with 43 million users around the globe, has its own plans for the metaverse.Chief executive David Baszucki has for several years been outlining his vision of it as a digital place where people play, work or learn with millions of 3D experiences.At Web Summit, Roblox's head of music Jon Vlassopulos told the BBC: ""I think our view of the metaverse is that we've been at it for about 15 years. ""So we're ushering in the metaverse, and we feel it needs to be a place that everyone can access, a place where people can express themselves and connect together.""We've been building around this vision for a long time. We're excited that more people are coming it to validate that notion.""Mr Cox was asked whether the metaverse - which Mr Carlson described as a ""cartoon world"" - was something that the tech giant should control.He said that there would need to be ""a set of standards and a set of protocols"" along with ""public discourse"" about how to keep the space safe.He added that Mr Zuckerberg was committed to safety, something he said the ""company had been working on for over a decade"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A020/production/_121429904_gettyimages-1351042109.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59154520,80,2021-11-04T12:49:45.000Z,technology
114,Instagram post previews to return on Twitter,"Instagram has brought back support for Twitter card previews after removing the feature nine years ago.Now, when users share an Instagram link on Twitter, a small preview of the post will be displayed.Instagram controversially removed the feature shortly after being acquired by Facebook in 2012.Twitter card previews started for some users on Wednesday and will eventually be available to everyone. Instagram and Twitter are both promoting the change.""If you want to share your latest Instagram post on the Twitter timeline too, you're in luck: now when you share a link to an IG post in a tweet, it'll show up as a card with a preview of the photo,"" read a tweet on Twitter's official support account.Instagram sparked controversy with users when it removed support for Twitter cards in 2012. The platform said that it wanted to take back control of its content following its merger with Facebook. Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom insisted at the time that the mandate came from himself, and not Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg. He said Instagram was attempting to grow its web platform and shared hopes that the move would help increase traffic.

115,Rwanda goes electric with locally made motorbikes,"For 12 years Didier Ndabahariye has been ferrying passengers around the streets of Kigali - one of the thousands of motorbike taxi drivers, known locally as a motos.Recently, he switched his usual ride for getting around Rwanda's capital for one of the first electric motorbikes on the African continent.""In the first days, things were not good because I was not used to riding e-motos and the bike sometimes cut-off.""However I went on working, and soon I knew many things about how the bike works and how to ride it. Then I started saving more money,"" Didier explains.He is one of 60 drivers riding an electric motorbike from the Rwandan firm Ampersand. ""Now I like the bikes - an e-moto can last for a long time without any problems unlike with an engine motor -  and it goes well, it is very smooth to ride.""The start-up Ampersand is pioneering the switch and hopes that over the next five years almost all of Rwanda's motorbikes will be electric.It is an ambitious dream - there are around 25,000 motorbike taxis operating in Kigali, some driving up to 10 hours a day, often covering hundreds of kilometres daily. ""Motorbikes make up more than half of all vehicles in this part of the world,"" says Ampersand chief executive Josh Whale. ""Their simple engines lack the sort of costly emissions reduction tech that you see in modern cars, or in motorbikes in the global north. Meanwhile they are being run for over 100km per day, so that's a lot of pollution, a lot of carbon [dioxide]. More Technology of Business""In Rwanda, drivers spend more in a year on petrol than the cost of a new motorbike. We've shown that we can offer an alternative in the same style as their current motorbike [that] costs less to buy, less to power and less to maintain.""Ampersand says that savings on fuel and maintenance can double a driver's income.With an estimated five million motorbikes on the roads of East Africa, there could be big savings in CO2 emissions if Ampersand and its rivals take a significant share of the market.Ampersand is more than just a technology platform. It assembles the motorbikes, the batteries and has set up charging stations.  Each motorbike has around 150 parts, which are assembled in Kigali. Particularly importantly, the battery packs are specially designed and prototyped by Ampersand engineers in Rwanda. They are then manufactured abroad and shipped back to Rwanda for final assembly by local technicians.Ampersand currently has 73 employees at its Rwandan motorcycle factory and is moving to a new facility this month as production grows.""For the time being we also happen to be a motorbike company, with spare parts and maintenance too. However we'd be glad to work with the big existing petrol motorbike manufacturers on the vehicle side of things.""We are still small and we want to move fast - as the climate crisis demands - and do some hard things quickly. So we're very happy to team up with big existing players where we can,"" Mr Whale says.The company has set up battery swap stations - where drivers exchange their depleted batteries for recharged ones - with five already in operation around Kigali.Each swap station costs around $5,000 (£3,700) - and the firm says it can build about 20 swap stations for the price of one conventional petrol station.Rwanda's government has a large role to play in moving to e-transportation, balancing the pros and cons of e-mobility. There will be a loss of fuel tax revenue - but the benefits include a shift to locally produced power sources, lower fuel importation costs and job creation if assembly takes place locally. The country has pioneered a range of incentives to encourage e-mobility.This includes capped electricity tariffs for charging stations and rent-free land for them, preferential parking and travel lanes for electric vehicles around Kigali, and restrictions on the ages and emissions of polluting vehicles.Established transport companies are also showing willingness to contribute to e-mobility efforts.In Rwanda, Volkswagen has been conducting an e-mobility pilot project since 2019 in partnership with Siemens, which has seen it launch 20 electric Golfs and two charging stations in Kigali.Volkswagen says the country has the potential to leapfrog internal combustion engines to electric cars.""Together with our development partner Siemens and with support from the government of Rwanda, Volkswagen aims to make the e-Golf pilot project a blueprint for electric mobility in Africa,"" says Andile Dlamini, of Volkswagen Group South Africa.For Ampersand, Rwanda has only been the first step in Africa, with the company currently launching in neighbouring Kenya and other countries shortly afterwards.  While there are challenges to rolling out electric vehicles across Africa - such as a shortage of specialised skills, the reticence of venture capital investors and disrupted supply chains - Mr Whale argues that the continent can be a leader in a global shift to e-mobility.The amount of working capital required is ""easily realistic"", he says, and could be put up by world governments to speed up roll out.  ""We hope we can show that the electric age is here - for everyone - and clean mobility isn't something that's just going to trickle down to the global south in a second-hand manner, decades from now.  Rather that it's cost-effective, fundable, investable - now.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/45CB/production/_121476871_amper.didier1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58820548,80,2021-11-09T00:00:30.000Z,technology
116,New ways into the lucrative world of data science,"What is a data scientist? The job title sprang out of nowhere as technology firms have scrambled to find people to perform sophisticated analytical tasks over the last decade. Reports of six-figure salaries abounded as businesses competed for staff to slice and dice data in pursuit of business lessons and emerging trends.Recruitment firm PageGroup cites annual salaries for data science work of between £60,000-150,000, while cautioning that the job title covers a huge range of disciplines and responsibilities. The line has become blurred between data science and other tasks such as data analysis. James Hobson, a technology specialist at PageGroup notes that ""there are different interpretations of what constitutes a data scientist"".Whatever the title, demand for staff has outstripped the supply of those traditionally considered suitable to the work, usually candidates with doctorates in computer science.A 2020 report into emerging jobs in the US by LinkedIn estimated that data science vacancies were growing at 37%  a year. So new entrants are coming into the field from unorthodox routes, aided by new software packages. Edward Green and Balraj Oates are two of those, although they both hesitate over the data scientist label. For Mr Green, his data science journey began at 15 when he embarked on series of extended stays in London's Great Ormond Street Hospital while being treated for a complex medical problem that required three bouts of surgery over two and a half years. Most of us would prefer to forget such an ordeal. But Mr Green remembers it as his gateway to a career working with technology. ""The day I had my first surgery was the day the iPad was released,"" he says. He joined the hospital's patient council and began capturing medical data on an iPad so it could be displayed to patients. This experiment saw him head straight into IT from school. His surgeon had worked with McLaren, studying the application of F1 pit stop techniques to the movement of patients in and out of intensive care. So motor racing - and work at McLaren's technology centre just outside London where data from cars are analysed - was his next step. At McLaren he uses data science software from US firm Alteryx that has developed its own self-service tool which can help people to become data experts.For Mr Green, it trained him to juggle vast quantities of data. In McLaren's case that means 1.5 terabytes worth collected from every race.  ""Sometimes the drivers feel they don't need this data, but they do,"" he says.More Technology of BusinessEuan Davis researches the future of work at Cognizant, a technology services group. He says that perceptions of the field have changed.""Data science used to be a very dry job. It was seen as nerdy but now it's creative. Communication matters because you have to sell what you uncover and that means telling stories around data."" The future belongs to people with soft skills just as much as to those who master hard data analysis, he says. ""The data science position is becoming a hybrid role. Now it's about being a trusted advisor. The data scientist has to be able to read the data in a way that tells something important to business executives.""Data visualisation tools, software that translates complex information into simple images, have changed the data science game, says Mr Davis: ""The tools are getting easier to use and more intuitive.""Various data analysis businesses such as Tableau and Cloudera offer this type of program, translating information into simple charts and icons for data scientists and others. This approach recognises that not everyone is comfortable trying to extract clear information from the bewildering columns of figures that appear in large spreadsheets. This new technology has created a grey area between the work of a data scientist and data analyst.Traditionally a data analyst might spend more time on routine analysis and providing regular reports. A data scientist would be responsible for the way data is manipulated. Mr Davis thinks this technology will prove reassuring in an era when ""our jobs are changing around machines and we have to understand data"".  Data science represented a dramatic change of direction for Balraj Oates.She was introduced to the discipline via a competitive event, a hackathon where players analysed global Covid case data to create regional comparisons of the pandemic. Alteryx software allowed her to drag and drop icons representing data sets such as death rates.Importantly, by manipulating icons rather than pages of calculations she could match the speed of analysis of a statistician on her team. She compares working with data science tools to using a calculator. This, she says, ""started my data journey"". It propelled her back into the working world after a 12-year break raising three children.Mrs Oates spotted the hackathon on the Women Returners website, which helps professionals returning to work after an extended career break.She mentioned her data science experience to another mother at her children's school who turned out to be seeking a data development specialist. Mrs Oates now applies her new-found knowledge in the financial services industry while her eldest child studies coding. ""It's never too late to think about developing a career and it's more accessible than you think"" Mrs Oates says, before adding how important it is to market yourself. ""I got into this work through a conversation at the school gate!""

117,Revealed: The Cryptoqueen's £13.5m London penthouse,"A money-laundering trial in Germany is shining a light on the purchase of a luxury London penthouse by cryptocurrency scammer Dr Ruja Ignatova. Jamie Bartlett and Rob Byrne of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast explain how she used British-based lawyers and wealth managers - who continued to offer their services after she disappeared.A former porter at the exclusive Abbots House apartment block in Kensington remembers meeting Dr Ruja Ignatova in 2016, as she returned from a shopping trip with her Bulgarian bodyguards. ""These two poor men came behind her like overloaded donkeys, struggling, and a bit out of breath - they must've had 20 bags each,"" says James (not his real name).Dr Ruja had been splashing out on designer-label goods - Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Calvin Klein - without regard for the expense.A little later, James got a look inside her four-bedroom penthouse flat, complete with swimming pool.""She had an Andy Warhol painting stuffed in the cupboard, and that broke my heart because I went to art college,"" says the ex-policeman.That was a print of the actress, Elizabeth Taylor. Another Warhol, Red Lenin, hung above the fireplace. To the left of a sofa in another reception room was a print of Queen Bubblegum by Michael Moebius, showing Queen Elizabeth blowing a bubble. Private Eye later estimated the flat contained works of art worth £500,000, bought from London's Halcyon gallery. James wondered whether Dr Ignatova was deliberately spreading her suspect wealth into assets that could be easily moved, to avoid them being seized.On 17 September Dr Ruja's German lawyer, Martin Breidenbach, went on trial in Münster, accused of money laundering for transferring 20 million euros to a London law firm to fund the purchase of the luxury property. Two others are also in the dock, facing charges connected to the siphoning of millions of euros from Dr Ruja's €4bn scam - which consisted of selling something that didn't exist, a fake cryptocurrency she called OneCoin.When the lease was signed in August 2016, financial regulators in at least one European country had already issued a warning about OneCoin. A few months earlier, Dr Ruja had pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges in a German court, after bankrupting a metal factory she'd bought and leaving 150 people jobless in 2011.But this wasn't widely known. Lawyers at Locke Lord, a US law firm with an office in London, did express concern about the source of the 20 million euros being transferred - this is apparent from internal emails revealed later in a US court case. But Dr Ruja's companies passed the firm's compliance checks, so they proceeded with the purchase of the property, along with Aquitaine Group, a Guernsey company offering tax haven services to wealthy clients.The penthouse had been refurbished by luxury property developers Candy & Candy after a fire that broke out while it was the London home of the singer, Duffy. The estate agent was Knight Frank. But quite who had bought the flat remained unclear to the outside world, thanks to British tax haven secrecy. According to the property deed its owner is Abbots House Penthouse Limited. This is an anonymous Guernsey shell company - one of 12,000 such companies that own properties in England and Wales - meaning that Dr Ruja's name would not have to appear on the UK deed, or in public records in the Channel Island. Other Guernsey firms were appointed as directors (or ""nominees""), and a couple of months after Dr Ruja's offer was accepted, Aquitaine was listed as the company's ""resident agent"" in Guernsey. The London address of Locke Lord, meanwhile, appeared on the penthouse's Land Registry documents. This appears to have been enough to conceal Dr Ruja's purchase of the property from the City of London Police, which told swindled OneCoin investors in September 2019 that they were ""unable to identify any OneCoin assets in the UK"".The truth was only revealed two months later, in emails read out in the money-laundering trial of a former Locke Lord employee in the US, Mark Scott.Some people in the area claim to remember their infamous ex-neighbour, but we've been told she only stayed briefly, in 2016.That year she seemed to be preparing to put down roots in London. She opened an office at the exclusive 1 Knightsbridge building and celebrated her 36th birthday with a lavish party at the Victoria and Albert Museum. We've also heard that she was making plans for her daughter to go to a private school in the UK one day.But mostly the 7,000 sq ft of the ""ultimate penthouse"", as Candy & Candy described it, remained empty. So far as we can tell, Dr Ruja didn't visit her Kensington pad at all in 2017 - and then on 25 October that year she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens, and vanished off the face of the Earth.James, the former porter, used to visit the flat daily to ventilate it. ""It was like a greenhouse up there,"" he said. The summer heat and direct light warped doors and faded the expensive artwork. Sometimes he would chase out pigeons that entered through a badly closing door.Occasionally other people connected with OneCoin would come to stay. In July 2018, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin - who took over as head of the scam a few months after her disappearance - posted a selfie taken inside the penthouse.James also remembers friends of Konstantin's visiting, and has identified Frank Schneider, Dr Ruja's head of security, as another guest who spent time there after she disappeared.Konstantin was arrested at Los Angeles International airport on 6 March 2019 and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. Schneider, the former head of Luxembourg's spy agency, was detained in France in April this year at the request of US authorities, and a decision on his extradition is expected this month.James says Schneider had been trying to arrange the sale of the penthouse, but our sources tell us it was rented out instead. Photos from a 2019 rental listing, also with Knight Frank, showed the Red Lenin still above the fireplace. There was no sign of the Liz portrait, but the eagle-eyed could spot the face of Dr Ruja herself on a special plate, gifted by one of her top promoters. We're told she hated it. While the flat was being prepared for renting, representatives of Aquitaine came and went. One had the locks changed. A former employee of Dr Ruja's told us that another carried out sacks full of luxury possessions.Law firm Locke Lord also continued to offer its services to Dr Ruja long after she went missing. A letter admitted in evidence at the US trial of ex-employee Mark Scott shows that on 12 July 2018 James Channo, a partner at the London branch of the firm, wrote to Dr Ruja about her UK properties.""We believe it is important that we revisit the manner in which you hold your real estate interests in the UK,"" he wrote.The letter, addressed to Dr Ruja at a Sofia address, was sent a couple of months before Scott's 2018 arrest, nine months after Dr Ruja's sudden disappearance, and 22 months after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority revealed in a warning to potential investors that the City of London Police was investigating OneCoin. Investigations into OneCoin or affiliated companies had also been announced in a number of other countries. Setting out the scope of the work he would like to do for £600 per hour, Mr Channo also sent email versions to Konstantin and Frank Schneider, all the while noting that email communication was ""not fully secure"".The letter contained no specific details of the UK properties, but Mr Channo cautioned Dr Ruja about the need to re-evaluate her UK property holdings, ""factoring issues such as tax, discretion of holding to the extent possible, and simplicity of structure"".A statement provided by Locke Lord and James Channo said the letter was an offer of legal services ""in a standard form"", that it was disclosed by Locke Lord to US prosecutors, and that no work was done for Dr Ruja as a result. One interesting line in the letter confirmed what our sources had been telling us - that it wasn't just the penthouse Dr Ruja had bought in the UK. On the fifth floor of Abbots House there's a less fancy two-bedroom apartment that ex-porter James told us Dr Ruja's bodyguards would stay in.UK records show the owner of 11 Abbots House is also a Guernsey shell company, Abbots Property Limited, and that it too is registered at Aquitaine's address. The smaller flat was also bought in 2016 - for £1.9m. Her name was again kept off the paperwork, but our sources say she was the one behind the purchase.Asked by the BBC about its dealings with Dr Ruja, Aquitaine said it had no comment to make. After she disappeared, 11 Abbots House seems to have taken on a different function, serving as a secret storage facility, which our sources tell us at one point housed two large safes. We've been told it was the immediate destination for valuables that were hurriedly cleared out of the penthouse by her staff, with the help of an Aquitaine employee, before it was rented out. Where Dr Ruja's luxury clothes, jewellery, shoes and some of her artwork went after that remains a mystery - like nearly everything with her. A former employee told us that her ""very coveted"" Louboutin shoes probably went to a charity shop, but couldn't account for the final destination of all of her possessions.It's possible some answers are known across the English Channel, in Guernsey.The existence of these London properties is interesting news for millions of victims of the OneCoin scam, who want Dr Ruja's assets to be sold and the proceeds distributed among investors. However, complex ownership structures - the Guernsey shell companies may be just the start - could make it difficult to prove that Dr Ruja is the legal owner.In the wake of the Pandora Papers, campaigners have repeated calls for a register of offshore property owners, which the UK government has promised but has so far failed to deliver. After pressure from MPs, in 2019 Guernsey and other Crown dependencies committed to making public the owners of companies based within their jurisdiction - but not until 2023.Victims campaigner Jen McAdam said the news that British-based lawyers, offshore wealth managers and estate agents were involved when Dr Ruja bought properties in London filled her with revulsion and anger.""This is almost certainly OneCoin victims' money that these properties have been purchased with, victims who for the last five years have been facing unimaginable emotional suffering and immense financial loss,"" she said. ""Now is not the time for the companies to remain quiet about their involvement, now is the time to be open, transparent and tell the truth. We want answers.""The BBC estimates that investors in the UK alone lost more than £100m. Jen McAdam also criticised the City of London Police for closing its investigation into OneCoin without making any charges in September 2019.A police spokesperson commented: ""The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations and will continue to do so. We have advised the investors with whom we have interacted with to contact the relevant law enforcement organisations directly.""Lawyers for James Channo and Locke Lord, the legal firm used by Ruja to buy the Kensington properties, emphasised that OneCoin had never been among its clients. It said Mark Scott's work for OneCoin was not done on behalf of Locke Lord and that the company had not been aware of it until he was charged with money-laundering, almost two years after he had left the company.Knight Frank, the estate agent, told the BBC: ""We always comply with our legal and regulatory obligations when carrying out financial transactions, and where appropriate, interact with the relevant authorities.""Martin Breidenbach, Dr Ruja's German lawyer, denies money-laundering. His trial is expected to last until May.Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast on BBC Sounds - the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova continues, and new episodes are planned in 2022",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/96FD/production/_121235683_redlenin_roof976.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-59062959,80,2021-11-03T00:06:41.000Z,technology
118,Why Africa urgently needs its own genetic library,"It was just a ""crazy idea"" to start with, says Ambroise Wonkam, professor of medical genetics at Cape Town university in South Africa.He is talking about his vision of creating a huge library of genetic information about the population of Africa, outlined in the science journal Nature, earlier this year.The Three Million African Genomes (3MAG) project emerged from his work on how genetic mutations among Africans contribute to conditions like sickle-cell disease and hearing impairments. He points out that African genes hold a wealth of genetic variation, beyond that observed by scientists in Europe and elsewhere.""We are all African but only a small fraction of Africans moved out of Africa about 20-40,000 years ago and settled in Europe and in Asia,"" he says.Prof Wonkam is also concerned about equity. ""Too little of the knowledge and applications from genomics have benefited the global south because of inequalities in health-care systems, a small local research workforce and lack of funding,"" he says.Only about 2% of the genomes mapped globally are African, and a good proportion of these are African American. This comes from a lack of prioritising funding, policies and training infrastructure, he says, but it also means the understanding of genetic medicine as a whole is lopsided. Studies of African genomes will also help to correct injustices, he says: ""Estimates of genetic risk scores for people of African descent that predict, say, the likelihood of cardiomyopathies or schizophrenia can be unreliable or even misleading using tools that work well in Europeans.""To address these inequities, Prof Wonkam and other scientists are talking to governments, companies and professional bodies across Africa and internationally, in order to build up capacity over the next decade to make the vision a reality. The number of three million is the minimum he expects to accurately map genetic variations across Africa. As a comparison, the UK Biobank currently aims to sequence half a million genomes in under three years, but   the UK's 68 million population is just a fraction of Africa's 1.3 billion. Prof Wonkam says the project will take 10 years, and will cost around $450m (£335m) per year, and says  industry is already showing an interest in it.Biotech firms say they welcome any expansion of the library of African genomes.The Centre for Proteomic and Genomic Research (CPGR) in Cape Town works with biotech firm Artisan Biomed on a variety of diagnostic tests.  The firm says it is affected by the gaps in the availability of genomic information relevant to local populations.For example, it may find a genetic mutation in someone and not know for certain if that variation is associated with a disease, especially as a marker for that particular population.""The more information you have at that level, the better the diagnosis, treatment and eventually care can be for any individual, regardless of your ethnicity,"" says Dr Lindsay Petersen, chief operations officer.More Technology of BusinessArtisan Biomed says the data it collects feeds back into CPGR's research - allowing them to design a better diagnostic toolkit that is better suited to African populations, for instance.""Because of the limited data sets of the African genome, it needs that hand in hand connection with research and innovation, because without that it's just another test that has been designed for a Caucasian population that may or may not have much of an effect within the African populations,"" says Dr Judith Hornby Cuff. She says the 3MAG project would help streamline processes and improve the development of research, and perhaps one day provide cheaper, more effective and more accessible health care, particularly in the strained South African system. One of those hoping to take part in the 3MAG project is Dr Aron Abera, genomics scientist at Inqaba Biotech in Pretoria, which offers genetic sequencing and other services to research and industry.The firm employs over 100 people in South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Currently, most of the genetics samples collected in these countries are still processed in South Africa, but Dr Abera hopes to increase the number of laboratories soon.The gaps are not only in infrastructure, but also in staff. Over the last 20 years, Inqaba has focused on using staff and interns from the African continent - but it now has to expand its training programme as well.Back in Cape Town, Prof Wonkam says that while the costs are huge, the project will ""improve capacity in a whole range of biomedical disciplines that will equip Africa to tackle public-health challenges more equitably"".He says: ""We have to be ambitious when we are in Africa. You have so many challenges you cannot see small, you have to see big - and really big.""Additional reporting by Tim Bowler",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11792/production/_120807517_wonkam2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58788040,80,2021-11-02T00:01:11.000Z,technology
119,Can we stomach the latest emerging food innovations?,"As world leaders gather in Glasgow, and prepare to chow down at numerous COP26 buffets, food technologists urgently want them to grasp the role alternative proteins might play combatting climate change. Researchers in many countries are looking for alternatives to traditional meat because farming animals is helping to drive up global temperatures.Even Hollywood stars have been jumping on the alternative protein bandwagon with with Leonardo Di Caprio among the most vocal. But aside from film stars, where are Wall Street and some of Europe's biggest institutional investors putting their money? We take a look at three of the hottest areas of this deliciously weird science.  Our thirst for non-dairy milk is already huge. One in three Brits now drink plant-based milk on a regular basis, says retail sector analyst Mintel. So, perhaps regularly eating meat that's never mooed, oinked, or encountered a farm may be a logical next step?No longer just the vision of a Margaret Attwood novel stuffed with chickienobs, in December 2020, Singapore became the first country to approve the sale of protein grown entirely in a laboratory. Scientists start by harvesting muscle cells from an animal, nutrients are steadily then added to feed those cells and grow the meat into tissue - this stew is called the cell media, which is then cultivated.San Francisco-based start-up, Eat Just, is now selling its lab-grown chicken nuggets in Singapore, a move that's part of the country's long-term security strategy so it can be less dependent on its neighbours for food imports. So, what are the barriers to many other countries doing the same? ""The real driver for all of this is getting regulatory approval,"" says Dr Carsten Gerhardt, a partner at consultancy, Kearney, which analyses the food and agriculture sectors. Some countries have more appetite for this than others. In Europe, the Netherlands is at the forefront of lab-grown meat technology where analysts expect producers Mosa Meat and Meatable to push for EU regulatory approval in the next few years. In the US, it is widely expected that Bill Gates-backed Memphis Meats and New Age Meats will do the same.  But regulation isn't the only hurdle to scaling-up and expanding the cultured-meat business, bringing down ingredient costs will be crucial. Most producers are still working with pharmaceutical-grade ingredients and nutrients, but if ""those could be lowered to normal food quality grades instead, then costs would come down significantly"", explains Mr Gerhardt. One part of the standard recipe involves growing cells in a syrupy bath of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), taken from pregnant cows' blood but Dutch scientists have now successfully replaced it and other animal components in its process. ""For ethical reasons, as well as for the simple reason FBS is very expensive and we could never produce meat at large scale for a broadly accessible price, we've succeeded in developing our own entirely animal component-free growth media,"" "" a company spokesperson for Mosa says.Still, farming meat in a lab is a slow, energy-intensive process and optimising this will also mean making the series of heating and cooling steps involved, much more energy efficient, although Jessica Almy, vice president of policy at The Good Food Institute says some producers are not that far off. Two separate studies out earlier this year found that, with investment, the production cost of cultivated meat could drop to compete with conventional meat by 2030. The Life Cycle study showed cultivated meat is also projected to comprise a staggering 35% of the global meat market by 2040.Several glowing reports suggest lab-grown meat may bring big environmental benefits - lower emissions plus less land and water usage than conventional farming. However, a more recent US study on expanding in-vitro production warns those benefits could come at the expense of much more intensive energy use as the whole process moves away from agriculture and becomes industrialised. Cyrille Filott, global strategist for consumer foods for Rabobank, says the question is how many boxes the lab grown product will tick for ""early adopters"" to remain interested. ""Taste, texture, price, sustainability, a long list of boxes. Will the novelty wear off or stick?""Mr Filott adds that an important intermediate milestone will be the acceptance of hybrid products. Hybrid products are plant-based meat substitutes that contain lab grown ingredients such as fats. If these products are accepted by the consumer, he says the development of fully lab-grown products might accelerate.A handful of firms are now working on 3D printers that could construct this dinner while you wait, by printing thousands of pre-programmed, sliver-thin layers, stacked on top of each other. The ""ink"" used is your food in paste format: printers that can design bespoke pancakes, ice cream and confectionery are already popular in some high-end supermarkets.However, Ms Almy says companies are now testing the water with much more sophisticated versions. 3D bio-printing can print cells and materials together to create a more complex structured product, like a marbled beef steak. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Extrusion technologies which have been used in the food industry for years - think hot dogs and pasta - are also being applied successfully in cultivated meat production. Barcelona firm Novameat has come up with one of the most realistic alternative meat products so far, thanks in part to its founder Giuseppe Scionti's expertise in bioengineering and tissue regeneration. It uses micro-extrusion tech to intricately print plant-based proteins in layers that build up in to a large cut of meat strong enough, and with the right texture, to be sliced with a carving knife, like a Sunday roast.Working with the faculty of biomedical engineering at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel-based firm Aleph Farms also created the worlds' first lab grown rib eye steak in this way, using 3D printing, in February.Alternatively, 3D printing can be used to create scaffolds from plant-based materials that allow cells to attach and grow into the final meat-based product. And if all this wasn't exciting enough, some printers then zap the result with lasers that will sizzle the food until it is cooked. Nanotechnology, or the science of manoeuvring teeny-tiny things around, is more commonly talked about in the manufacture of chips for phones, than fries. However, it also has many potential applications in the food sector. Using miniscule nanomaterials it is now possible to create packaging that keeps the products held inside edible for longer. Nanopack is a cling-film-like prototype for packaging that has smaller-than-the-eye-can-see mineral nanotubes dispersed inside it - these hold natural essential oils from plants like oregano and thyme with antimicrobial properties. The nanotubes slowly release antimicrobial oils from the film into the headspace of the packaged food which actively slows down oxidation, moisture changes and microbial growth, says Prof Ester Segal from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology who oversaw the project.  Early experiments showed the film prevented the growth of mould in bread by three weeks and extended the sale time of fresh cherries and shelf life of cheese by 40% and 50%, respectively.The supermarket of the future may go even further, incorporating intelligent food packaging with tiny nanosensors, which Dr Seda Erdem at Stirling University adds may ""report and relay"" updated information back to the shopper about their contents. And what about when it comes to manipulating the food itself? Research from several countries shows almost endless possibilities - to enhance the flavour and texture of foods, reduce fat content, or to encapsulate nutrients such as vitamins to ensure they do not degrade during a product's shelf life.In this area however, UK regulator, The Food Standards Agency in its latest report still seems a little queasy, taking a very a cautious stance as it remains unclear what the long-term impact of tinkering with these tiny building blocks could be on the rest of the food chain.

122,Evergrande: Crisis-hit developer raises more cash as new deadline looms,"Cash-strapped Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has raised around $145m (£107m) just before a deadline for a fresh debt interest payment.The company has sold a 5.7% stake in media firm HengTen Networks Group which produces films and television shows, and operates a streaming platform.Evergrande needs to make overdue interest payments of $148m this week.It has so far avoided defaulting on its debts by making overdue payments just before 30-day grace periods expired.Evergrande owned a majority stake in HengTen at the beginning of this year, but has since made a number of share sales as it tries to raise money to meet its financial commitments.HengTen's other big corporate shareholder is Chinese technology giant Tencent - it bought a 7% stake from Evergrande for about $266m in July.The latest share sale now makes Tencent the media company's biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 24%.Apart from HengTen, Evergrande also sold its UK-based electric motor making business Protean in the last week.It didn't say how much it earned from the sale of the company, which its vehicle manufacturing unit bought for $58m in 2019.However, Evergrande has struggled to sell some of its other assets in recent months as it attempts to raise the money needed to make debt interest payments.Last month, the company halted trading in its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ahead of an announcement on a ""major transaction"".Then, after a 17-day suspension Evergrande said a $2.6bn deal to sell a stake in its property services unit had fallen through as it was unable to agree to the deal's terms.Evergrande's $300bn debt mountain and the company's problems with making debt repayments have triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/39A6/production/_121485741_tv071460717.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59216504,80,2021-11-09T04:45:50.000Z,entertainment
123,Rolls-Royce gets funding to develop mini nuclear reactors,"Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy.The creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a £195m cash injection from private firms and a £210m grant from the government.It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050.However, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear.Currently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power.Small modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones.The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK.It will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise.Rolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement.Rolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes.The firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines.Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a ""clean energy solution"" which help tackle climate change.Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to ""cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further"".""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence"", he added.SMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs.At an expected cost of around £2bn each, SMRs would cost less than the £20bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.If approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production.Tom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to ""deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants"".""Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,"" he added.However, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources.""If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doing… we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,"" he said.Greenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was ""still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located"".""What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,"" he added. ""The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that.""Friends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be ""aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste"".As part of a ""10-point plan"" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"" and that it is ""pursuing large-scale nuclear"", while also looking to invest in SMRs.Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a ""hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall"".Meanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a ""huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/73CF/production/_121474692_rolls_nuclear51179493335_0c31026131_6k.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59212983,80,2021-11-09T08:44:18.000Z,entertainment
124,Matt Moulding: The billionaire THG boss facing a reality check,"The news flow about THG, the company formerly known as The Hut Group, was breathless. The rag-to-riches story of billionaire boss Matthew Moulding, the pictures on Instagram of his muscled torso stripped to his waist, the dealmaking, the creator of a tech business the UK could be proud of, the generous bonus scheme: it seemed unending.When Mr Moulding listed his fast-growing health and beauty firm - which includes a potentially highly lucrative software arm - on the London stock market last year, the hyperactive media went into overdrive about a big business success and a big personality.Much was made of the company's extensive portfolio of brands, including ESPA, Perricone MD and Illamasqua, as well as online beauty retailer Lookfantastic.Now the bubble has burst, although in truth, it was probably more of a slow deflation over several months. Billions of pounds have been wiped off THG's value after a series of challenges over its structure, its corporate governance and a deal with Japanese investor Softbank to buy a stake in its technology business Ingenuity.But with Mr Moulding now hinting he may take the company private again, a little over a year since it floated, the saga is clearly not over yet.Despite THG being a public company, owned by its shareholders, Mr Moulding had until recently a ""golden share"" that gave him rare powers to veto a takeover of the business.The founder, who has a 22% stake in THG, is also chairman and chief executive, a move which puts the firm at odds with City guidance on corporate governance, which recommends the roles should be separated. THG also pays Mr Moulding about £19m a year after he took control of some of the company's properties around the time of the float, which he now leases back to the business. Mr Moulding and his wife Jodie also have a £100m personal loan from Barclays, which had been secured against THG shares. However, the company now says the couple are no longer using THG shares as collateral for the loan, which is apparently still active.Unease over this corporate governance structure had been developing for some time. At a meeting last month, Mr Moulding updated shareholders on trading and, specifically, its Ingenuity technology division. It's still unclear exactly what went on, but investors didn't like what they heard. Actually, there are reports they didn't hear very much, because the update contained little that was material to the business. Shareholders wanted change in the way THG was run. Many investors voted with their wallets, selling THG shares and triggering a 35% tumble. At one point, THG's value sank almost £2bn.Following that, THG announced changes to Mr Moulding's powers and a review of its corporate governance. The City appeared to have won. It seemed a rare defeat for the 49-year-old billionaire - but he is clearly hoping to fight back.Born in Lancashire on the poor side of the tracks, the young Mr Moulding's prospects were not promising. His father repaired driveways and sold goods procured from house clearances at a market.Matthew was expelled from college for truancy. He was, though, persuaded to finish his education and eventually went to university, going on to qualify as a chartered accountant.He cut his entrepreneurial teeth working for John Caudwell, the Phones4U billionaire and another non-conformist businessman. When Mr Caudwell sold the business, Mr Moulding used some of the money he got from the sale to set out on his own.Mr Moulding has said that he got the inspiration for setting up his own firm by buying his first CD online back in 2003.He said it was ""fundamentally so much cheaper"" than picking one up in a shop that he decided to take up that business model himself.He was in his early 30s when he launched THG with co-founder John Gallemore, who remains chief financial officer.With an initial investment of £50,000, Mr Moulding began by selling CDs from the Channel Islands to avoid VAT, making use of a then-prevalent tax loophole which has since been closed.Since then, the firm has gone through various changes, moving away from its roots when the rise of music streaming started to undermine the CD market.Using the infrastructure he had already created, he hit on switching to health and beauty products, since they were not perishable or delicate and had high profit margins.The company grew rapidly by snapping up skincare and lifestyle brands, while also operating online platforms for other companies, including Honda and Nestlé.Mr Moulding has certainly made a lot of money for himself, but the stock market flotation also reportedly made 74 employees millionaires. And since the flotation, he has also given bucketloads of cash to charities.His latest possible change of direction, unusually, was signposted in an interview with men's magazine GQ - not usually a must-read for financial analysts.But maybe it's that kind of star quality that he is counting on to see him through as he prepares for his next set of challenges.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FBD2/production/_121166446_gettyimages-1187780790-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58951739,80,2021-11-08T23:57:47.000Z,entertainment
125,Workers who want flexible work roles missing out,"Three out of four jobs advertised in the UK still do not offer any kind of flexible work options, according to an annual survey of over five million ads.This is set against a backdrop of vacancies soaring to a 20-year high of 1.1 million between July and September. Flexible work consultancy, Timewise, tracked millions of ads for 17 words or phrases, such as job-share. From this analysis they found that the proportion of ads posted with a flexible component was just 26%.Over the last 19 months the coronavirus pandemic has delivered a seismic shake-up in many professions - flipping a large chunk of the workforce to remote-working overnight. Around half of employees now work flexibly in some form, while nine in 10 people say they want flexibility in their next position.One of these jobseekers is Carole MacLeod, who before she had her daughter had a high-flying career as a consultant for a major UK telecoms provider. She managed C-suite executives at major events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. Now in her fifties, she's finding it impossible to find similar level work. ""Now I cannot find a single good flexible job to apply for,"" she said. ""The market is flooded with jobs. But none that offer a decent wage, good enjoyable professional type work and flexibility too,"" she said. ""The kind of jobs that are available tend to be in hospitality, offering long poorly paid shifts that are below my skillset. Recruiters won't even answer the phone. I think I have applied for maybe one hundred jobs at various universities and academic institutions in central London. I find it bewildering.""Carole is not alone: there are many mid-career workers who, despite a recent surge in job adverts as Covid restrictions eased, still cannot find work that fits with their need for flexibility and level of experience.The work landscape has shifted but experts say the way roles are advertised suggest bosses have failed to adapt to find the best talent. ""Employers that don't include their flexible working offering within their job ads are making a huge mistake,"" said Professor Sir Cary Cooper, Organisational Psychologist at Alliance Manchester Business School. ""The hybrid model is what the majority of people want - and are currently practising."" The Timewise survey also revealed part-time work and low pay are still synonymous in the UK. Some 19% of the low paid jobs advertised -those paying up to £20,000 full time equivalent -mentioned part-time possibilities. The highest chunk of any salary band.Prof Cooper explained senior management may be making a conscious decision not to reference the term flexible working in any external communication ""because they fear potential employees will think that they have the automatic right to work remotely 24/7.""He points out however, that's not the reality for most workers. ""Most people are tired of working in this way. What they're looking for is a mix of being in the office and at home, so they can interact with other colleagues but also have the freedom to take time at home if they need it to juggle other life demands.""

126,"Food price rises highest since August 2020, says Kantar","Food prices are rising at their fastest pace since August 2020, figures from data firm Kantar suggest, as supply chain disruption continues.Grocery inflation rose to 2.1% in October - the highest rate since last year, when retailers were cutting promotions amid the Covid pandemic.Last week, the Bank of England confounded market expectations by holding interest rates.But with overall inflation heading for about 5%, a rate rise is expected soon.Supply chains have been under pressure from factors including the pandemic and a shortage of lorry drivers.Retail and hospitality groups warned MPs on Tuesday that gaps on shelves and inflationary pressures would continue for the months ahead.Kantar said that the fastest rising food prices included savoury snacks, canned colas and crisps. However, prices fell for products such as fresh bacon, vegetables and cat and dog treats.""Grocery prices are rising and this month inflation hit its highest rate since August 2020, when retailers were still cutting promotions to maintain stock on the shelves,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.""As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals.""Official figures showed overall UK inflation dipped slightly in September, with the rate falling to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in October.However, Shore Capital research analyst Clive Black said that some people were ""struggling to believe"" the inflation numbers from the Office for National Statistics.He said the figures were ""increasingly treated not with scepticism but incredulity as prices from fuel, energy, food, and building materials rise, offset by what?""Fuel and oil prices have risen rapidly as economies start to pick up after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and as the Opec oil producers' cartel gradually increases output.Shortages and bottlenecks in goods including building materials and computer chips have also pushed up prices.Businesses are having difficulties recruiting workers to drive lorries, pick and process food and to staff bars, hotels and restaurants.This is partly to do with the pandemic but is being compounded by Brexit, according to international policy forum the OECD.However, the Bank of England's deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated the pandemic is having a greater impact on labour shortages than Brexit currently.Mr Broadbent stressed that it's not just a case of losing migrants as workers - but also their spending power in the economy, as many EU workers were younger and economically active.He added the pandemic has led to a fall in the active workforce that is ""not unique"" to the UK, shown by the retirement of HGV drivers and younger restaurant staff choosing to go into education. Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UK Hospitality, warned that prices charged by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels were set to rise after Christmas.Speaking to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, she said that many Christmas events offered by her members had been pre-booked, which made it harder to push through price increases to cover higher costs.""You're going to see a really intense squeeze on margins in the run-up to Christmas,"" she said, but then prices were likely to rise in the new year.""Some of our businesses are anticipating three price increases to consumers going through before we get to April.""Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told MPs it ""will be Christmas as we know it"" in shops, but the range of products will be reduced, as is already the case in lots of food categories.Several retailers have reported that customers are planning ahead for Christmas and shopping early amid concerns over shortages of stock.Kantar data supported this, with the firm saying that 4.7 million households bought mince pies this month.Frozen poultry sales are 27% higher compared with last year, with people spending an additional £6.1m in the past four weeks.In addition, 1.6 million households bought their Christmas pudding in October as well, which is 400,000 more than last year, Kantar said.Customers are getting used to seeing gaps on shelves, and menu items missing in restaurants, and we're already shopping differently as a result. Gone are the days of the Christmas Eve mega-shop where you pile everything you need into an impossible to push trolley. Now we're buying early, freezing more, and throwing in a few extra bits when they are available, just in case.It's almost impossible for businesses to predict what those holes will be from one week to the next, as worker shortages in the supply chain continue to cause problems. That means we'll not only be shopping around to try and save money as prices rise, but we'll also have to try different stores at different moments just to get everything on the list.

127,Bank of England takes next steps in digital money plan,"The Bank of England and the Treasury are to launch a formal consultation on a UK central bank digital currency.This evaluation of the design and possible benefits a new kind of digital money is a further step towards its possible creation.The currency, for use by households and businesses, would sit alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them.No decision has been taken on whether to have such a currency in the UK.But the consultation in 2022 will form part of a ""research and exploration"" phase and will help the Bank and government develop the plans over the following few years.Central banks around the world are developing or exploring digital currencies after the rise of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.China, for example, is a front-runner in this global race, and is in the process of testing a digital yuan in major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.Its next steps are to improve the eCNY currency's privacy protections and to improve how it interacts with other payments tools, People's Bank of China governor Yi Gang said on Tuesday.The UK's central bank digital currency (CBDC) is not so far advanced as the Chinese effort, with the with earliest date for the launch of a UK CBDC in the second half of the decade.The consultation paper will set out an assessment from the Treasury and and the Bank of the case for a CBDC before a decision on whether to proceed.""A technical specification would follow the consultation explaining the proposed conceptual architecture for any CBDC.""This could involve in-depth testing of the optimal design for, and feasibility of, a UK CBDC,"" the Bank said in a statement.Financial services minister John Glen said a retail CBDC would be used by people and businesses for everyday payments needs and helping Britain stay at the forefront of innovation and technology in the financial sector.The European Central Bank in July took a first step towards launching a digital version of the euro, kicking off a 24-month investigation phase to be followed by three years of implementation.Work on a digital euro accelerated after Facebook unveiled plans to create its own currency in 2019, although Facebook later thought again about plans for its Libra currency after strong opposition from regulators, and renamed it ""Diem"" .While China has been at the forefront of CBDC moves, the US Federal Reserve has been more sceptical.Some central banks have warned that widespread use of CBDCs could deprive banks of a cheap and stable source of funding from consumer deposits.Last month, Nigeria was the first African country to launch a CBDC pilot and in September, El Salvador became the first country to use the virtual Bitcoin currency as a legal tender, alongside the US dollar.It led to widespread protests as demonstrators feared it would bring instability and inflation to the country.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12317/production/_121491547_digitalcurrency.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59223340,80,2021-11-09T18:48:46.000Z,entertainment
128,Evergrande: Crisis-hit developer raises more cash as new deadline looms,"Cash-strapped Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has raised around $145m (£107m) just before a deadline for a fresh debt interest payment.The company has sold a 5.7% stake in media firm HengTen Networks Group which produces films and television shows, and operates a streaming platform.Evergrande needs to make overdue interest payments of $148m this week.It has so far avoided defaulting on its debts by making overdue payments just before 30-day grace periods expired.Evergrande owned a majority stake in HengTen at the beginning of this year, but has since made a number of share sales as it tries to raise money to meet its financial commitments.HengTen's other big corporate shareholder is Chinese technology giant Tencent - it bought a 7% stake from Evergrande for about $266m in July.The latest share sale now makes Tencent the media company's biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 24%.Apart from HengTen, Evergrande also sold its UK-based electric motor making business Protean in the last week.It didn't say how much it earned from the sale of the company, which its vehicle manufacturing unit bought for $58m in 2019.However, Evergrande has struggled to sell some of its other assets in recent months as it attempts to raise the money needed to make debt interest payments.Last month, the company halted trading in its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ahead of an announcement on a ""major transaction"".Then, after a 17-day suspension Evergrande said a $2.6bn deal to sell a stake in its property services unit had fallen through as it was unable to agree to the deal's terms.Evergrande's $300bn debt mountain and the company's problems with making debt repayments have triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/39A6/production/_121485741_tv071460717.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59216504,80,2021-11-09T04:45:50.000Z,entertainment
129,Rolls-Royce gets funding to develop mini nuclear reactors,"Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy.The creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a £195m cash injection from private firms and a £210m grant from the government.It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050.However, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear.Currently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power.Small modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones.The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK.It will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise.Rolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement.Rolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes.The firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines.Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a ""clean energy solution"" which help tackle climate change.Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to ""cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further"".""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence"", he added.SMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs.At an expected cost of around £2bn each, SMRs would cost less than the £20bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.If approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production.Tom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to ""deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants"".""Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,"" he added.However, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources.""If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doing… we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,"" he said.Greenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was ""still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located"".""What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,"" he added. ""The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that.""Friends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be ""aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste"".As part of a ""10-point plan"" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"" and that it is ""pursuing large-scale nuclear"", while also looking to invest in SMRs.Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a ""hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall"".Meanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a ""huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/73CF/production/_121474692_rolls_nuclear51179493335_0c31026131_6k.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59212983,80,2021-11-09T08:44:18.000Z,entertainment

However, prices fell for products such as fresh bacon, vegetables and cat and dog treats.""Grocery prices are rising and this month inflation hit its highest rate since August 2020, when retailers were still cutting promotions to maintain stock on the shelves,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.""As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals.""Official figures showed overall UK inflation dipped slightly in September, with the rate falling to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in October.However, Shore Capital research analyst Clive Black said that some people were ""struggling to believe"" the inflation numbers from the Office for National Statistics.He said the figures were ""increasingly treated not with scepticism but incredulity as prices from fuel, energy, food, and building materials rise, offset by what?""Fuel and oil prices have risen rapidly as economies start to pick up after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and as the Opec oil producers' cartel gradually increases output.Shortages and bottlenecks in goods including building materials and computer chips have also pushed up prices.Businesses are having difficulties recruiting workers to drive lorries, pick and process food and to staff bars, hotels and restaurants.This is partly to do with the pandemic but is being compounded by Brexit, according to international policy forum the OECD.However, the Bank of England's deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated the pandemic is having a greater impact on labour shortages than Brexit currently.Mr Broadbent stressed that it's not just a case of losing migrants as workers - but also their spending power in the economy, as many EU workers were younger and economically active.He added the pandemic has led to a fall in the active workforce that is ""not unique"" to the UK, shown by the retirement of HGV drivers and younger restaurant staff choosing to go into education. Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UK Hospitality, warned that prices charged by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels were set to rise after Christmas.Speaking to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, she said that many Christmas events offered by her members had been pre-booked, which made it harder to push through price increases to cover higher costs.""You're going to see a really intense squeeze on margins in the run-up to Christmas,"" she said, but then prices were likely to rise in the new year.""Some of our businesses are anticipating three price increases to consumers going through before we get to April.""Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told MPs it ""will be Christmas as we know it"" in shops, but the range of products will be reduced, as is already the case in lots of food categories.Several retailers have reported that customers are planning ahead for Christmas and shopping early amid concerns over shortages of stock.Kantar data supported this, with the firm saying that 4.7 million households bought mince pies this month.Frozen poultry sales are 27% higher compared with last year, with people spending an additional £6.1m in the past four weeks.In addition, 1.6 million households bought their Christmas pudding in October as well, which is 400,000 more than last year, Kantar said.Customers are getting used to seeing gaps on shelves, and menu items missing in restaurants, and we're already shopping differently as a result. Gone are the days of the Christmas Eve mega-shop where you pile everything you need into an impossible to push trolley. Now we're buying early, freezing more, and throwing in a few extra bits when they are available, just in case.It's almost impossible for businesses to predict what those holes will be from one week to the next, as worker shortages in the supply chain continue to cause problems. That means we'll not only be shopping around to try and save money as prices rise, but we'll also have to try different stores at different moments just to get everything on the list.

133,Evergrande: Crisis-hit developer raises more cash as new deadline looms,"Cash-strapped Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has raised around $145m (£107m) just before a deadline for a fresh debt interest payment.The company has sold a 5.7% stake in media firm HengTen Networks Group which produces films and television shows, and operates a streaming platform.Evergrande needs to make overdue interest payments of $148m this week.It has so far avoided defaulting on its debts by making overdue payments just before 30-day grace periods expired.Evergrande owned a majority stake in HengTen at the beginning of this year, but has since made a number of share sales as it tries to raise money to meet its financial commitments.HengTen's other big corporate shareholder is Chinese technology giant Tencent - it bought a 7% stake from Evergrande for about $266m in July.The latest share sale now makes Tencent the media company's biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 24%.Apart from HengTen, Evergrande also sold its UK-based electric motor making business Protean in the last week.It didn't say how much it earned from the sale of the company, which its vehicle manufacturing unit bought for $58m in 2019.However, Evergrande has struggled to sell some of its other assets in recent months as it attempts to raise the money needed to make debt interest payments.Last month, the company halted trading in its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ahead of an announcement on a ""major transaction"".Then, after a 17-day suspension Evergrande said a $2.6bn deal to sell a stake in its property services unit had fallen through as it was unable to agree to the deal's terms.Evergrande's $300bn debt mountain and the company's problems with making debt repayments have triggered fears that its potential collapse could send shockwaves through global markets.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/39A6/production/_121485741_tv071460717.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59216504,80,2021-11-09T04:45:50.000Z,entertainment
134,Rolls-Royce gets funding to develop mini nuclear reactors,"Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy.The creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a £195m cash injection from private firms and a £210m grant from the government.It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050.However, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear.Currently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power.Small modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones.The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK.It will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise.Rolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement.Rolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes.The firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines.Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a ""clean energy solution"" which help tackle climate change.Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to ""cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further"".""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence"", he added.SMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs.At an expected cost of around £2bn each, SMRs would cost less than the £20bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.If approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production.Tom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to ""deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants"".""Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,"" he added.However, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources.""If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doing… we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,"" he said.Greenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was ""still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located"".""What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,"" he added. ""The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that.""Friends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be ""aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste"".As part of a ""10-point plan"" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"" and that it is ""pursuing large-scale nuclear"", while also looking to invest in SMRs.Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a ""hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall"".Meanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a ""huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/73CF/production/_121474692_rolls_nuclear51179493335_0c31026131_6k.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59212983,80,2021-11-09T08:44:18.000Z,entertainment
135,Matt Moulding: The billionaire THG boss facing a reality check,"The news flow about THG, the company formerly known as The Hut Group, was breathless. The rag-to-riches story of billionaire boss Matthew Moulding, the pictures on Instagram of his muscled torso stripped to his waist, the dealmaking, the creator of a tech business the UK could be proud of, the generous bonus scheme: it seemed unending.When Mr Moulding listed his fast-growing health and beauty firm - which includes a potentially highly lucrative software arm - on the London stock market last year, the hyperactive media went into overdrive about a big business success and a big personality.Much was made of the company's extensive portfolio of brands, including ESPA, Perricone MD and Illamasqua, as well as online beauty retailer Lookfantastic.Now the bubble has burst, although in truth, it was probably more of a slow deflation over several months. Billions of pounds have been wiped off THG's value after a series of challenges over its structure, its corporate governance and a deal with Japanese investor Softbank to buy a stake in its technology business Ingenuity.But with Mr Moulding now hinting he may take the company private again, a little over a year since it floated, the saga is clearly not over yet.Despite THG being a public company, owned by its shareholders, Mr Moulding had until recently a ""golden share"" that gave him rare powers to veto a takeover of the business.The founder, who has a 22% stake in THG, is also chairman and chief executive, a move which puts the firm at odds with City guidance on corporate governance, which recommends the roles should be separated. THG also pays Mr Moulding about £19m a year after he took control of some of the company's properties around the time of the float, which he now leases back to the business. Mr Moulding and his wife Jodie also have a £100m personal loan from Barclays, which had been secured against THG shares. However, the company now says the couple are no longer using THG shares as collateral for the loan, which is apparently still active.Unease over this corporate governance structure had been developing for some time. At a meeting last month, Mr Moulding updated shareholders on trading and, specifically, its Ingenuity technology division. It's still unclear exactly what went on, but investors didn't like what they heard. Actually, there are reports they didn't hear very much, because the update contained little that was material to the business. Shareholders wanted change in the way THG was run. Many investors voted with their wallets, selling THG shares and triggering a 35% tumble. At one point, THG's value sank almost £2bn.Following that, THG announced changes to Mr Moulding's powers and a review of its corporate governance. The City appeared to have won. It seemed a rare defeat for the 49-year-old billionaire - but he is clearly hoping to fight back.Born in Lancashire on the poor side of the tracks, the young Mr Moulding's prospects were not promising. His father repaired driveways and sold goods procured from house clearances at a market.Matthew was expelled from college for truancy. He was, though, persuaded to finish his education and eventually went to university, going on to qualify as a chartered accountant.He cut his entrepreneurial teeth working for John Caudwell, the Phones4U billionaire and another non-conformist businessman. When Mr Caudwell sold the business, Mr Moulding used some of the money he got from the sale to set out on his own.Mr Moulding has said that he got the inspiration for setting up his own firm by buying his first CD online back in 2003.He said it was ""fundamentally so much cheaper"" than picking one up in a shop that he decided to take up that business model himself.He was in his early 30s when he launched THG with co-founder John Gallemore, who remains chief financial officer.With an initial investment of £50,000, Mr Moulding began by selling CDs from the Channel Islands to avoid VAT, making use of a then-prevalent tax loophole which has since been closed.Since then, the firm has gone through various changes, moving away from its roots when the rise of music streaming started to undermine the CD market.Using the infrastructure he had already created, he hit on switching to health and beauty products, since they were not perishable or delicate and had high profit margins.The company grew rapidly by snapping up skincare and lifestyle brands, while also operating online platforms for other companies, including Honda and Nestlé.Mr Moulding has certainly made a lot of money for himself, but the stock market flotation also reportedly made 74 employees millionaires. And since the flotation, he has also given bucketloads of cash to charities.His latest possible change of direction, unusually, was signposted in an interview with men's magazine GQ - not usually a must-read for financial analysts.But maybe it's that kind of star quality that he is counting on to see him through as he prepares for his next set of challenges.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FBD2/production/_121166446_gettyimages-1187780790-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58951739,80,2021-11-08T23:57:47.000Z,entertainment
136,Workers who want flexible work roles missing out,"Three out of four jobs advertised in the UK still do not offer any kind of flexible work options, according to an annual survey of over five million ads.This is set against a backdrop of vacancies soaring to a 20-year high of 1.1 million between July and September. Flexible work consultancy, Timewise, tracked millions of ads for 17 words or phrases, such as job-share. From this analysis they found that the proportion of ads posted with a flexible component was just 26%.Over the last 19 months the coronavirus pandemic has delivered a seismic shake-up in many professions - flipping a large chunk of the workforce to remote-working overnight. Around half of employees now work flexibly in some form, while nine in 10 people say they want flexibility in their next position.One of these jobseekers is Carole MacLeod, who before she had her daughter had a high-flying career as a consultant for a major UK telecoms provider. She managed C-suite executives at major events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. Now in her fifties, she's finding it impossible to find similar level work. ""Now I cannot find a single good flexible job to apply for,"" she said. ""The market is flooded with jobs. But none that offer a decent wage, good enjoyable professional type work and flexibility too,"" she said. ""The kind of jobs that are available tend to be in hospitality, offering long poorly paid shifts that are below my skillset. Recruiters won't even answer the phone. I think I have applied for maybe one hundred jobs at various universities and academic institutions in central London. I find it bewildering.""Carole is not alone: there are many mid-career workers who, despite a recent surge in job adverts as Covid restrictions eased, still cannot find work that fits with their need for flexibility and level of experience.The work landscape has shifted but experts say the way roles are advertised suggest bosses have failed to adapt to find the best talent. ""Employers that don't include their flexible working offering within their job ads are making a huge mistake,"" said Professor Sir Cary Cooper, Organisational Psychologist at Alliance Manchester Business School. ""The hybrid model is what the majority of people want - and are currently practising."" The Timewise survey also revealed part-time work and low pay are still synonymous in the UK. Some 19% of the low paid jobs advertised -those paying up to £20,000 full time equivalent -mentioned part-time possibilities. The highest chunk of any salary band.Prof Cooper explained senior management may be making a conscious decision not to reference the term flexible working in any external communication ""because they fear potential employees will think that they have the automatic right to work remotely 24/7.""He points out however, that's not the reality for most workers. ""Most people are tired of working in this way. What they're looking for is a mix of being in the office and at home, so they can interact with other colleagues but also have the freedom to take time at home if they need it to juggle other life demands."" Emma Stewart, co-founder of Timewise tells employers to be as explicit as possible about what forms of 'flex' they can offer. For example, 'this role can be offered on a three-day week basis'. ""We know nearly half of job seekers click away from roles that say 'open to flexible working'. They seek out ads which reflect the kind of flexible pattern they are looking for. Just as you search for jobs within a set salary range,"" she said. Janine Bosak, professor of Organisational Psychology at Dublin City University Business School said there might be several reasons why employers remain hesitant to refer to flexible working in ads. For example, when someone starts a new job, employers might prefer they be physically present to learn the ropes and company culture. ""Employers might also be reluctant to mention flexible working in their advertising materials as it might be perceived as a right to flexible working, whereas it might not always be possible to accommodate a desire for flexible working,"" she added.

138,Tesla share price falls after Elon Musk's Twitter poll,"Tesla shares have fallen by 4.9% after Twitter users voted in favour of boss Elon Musk selling 10% of his stake in the carmaker in order to pay tax.Mr Musk polled his Twitter followers on whether he should sell the shares, and 58% of the 3.5 million accounts that voted said he should.It could see him dispose of nearly $21bn (£16bn) of stock.Mr Musk held the poll over the weekend in response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats.Mr Musk - who is one of the world's richest people - pledged that he would abide by the results of the poll, ""whichever way it goes"".The Democrats had proposed plans to target billionaires by taxing their assets, such as shares. Billionaires are often compensated in shares, which means their wealth rises or falls depending on the stock price. But they only pay tax on the gains once the shares are sold.   Mr Musk has a large number of stock options which are due to expire next year. In order to exercise them, Mr Musk would have to pay a large tax bill. As of 30 June, Mr Musk's shareholding in Tesla came to about 170.5 million shares and selling 10% would amount to close to $21bn based on Friday's closing prices.The chief executive, who currently owns a 23% stake in Tesla, has yet to comment publicly on the Twitter poll result.Mr Musk said on Twitter he takes no salary or bonuses from any of his companies, meaning he has no earnings on which to pay income tax.""Elon Musk doesn't like to do things in a conventional way and so holding a poll on Twitter about whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla might seem crazy, but one could say it is normal behaviour for him,"" said Russ Mould, director at AJ Bell Investment.Mr Mould said the situation was an ""open invitation for sellers to ""place a bet that the shares will fall"" which would generate a profit for them if the stock declined in price.The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, declined to comment.By Lucy Hooker, BBC business reporterWith this latest Twitter stunt Mr Musk appears to be taking aim at a Democrat plan to ratchet up taxes on America's wealthiest.The plan, floated earlier this year would change the way Americans are taxed, but it only applied to around 700 individuals, the richest of America's richest, including Mr Musk.Typically the very wealthy keep their money in the form of assets such as shares in their own companies, and only pay tax if they sell those shares. They can borrow money using those assets as collateral, avoiding the levels of tax most ordinary people pay. The plan proposed levying tax based on how much those assets had increased in value, even if they hadn't been sold, known as ""unrealised gains"".But it has been set aside for now after some Democratic senators dissented.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0B02/production/_121481820_gettyimages-1229893385.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59209942,80,2021-11-08T15:49:16.000Z,entertainment
139,Covid-19: US reopens border to UK travellers after almost two years,"UK visitors are now able to travel to the US for the first time in nearly two years.The border reopened at 05:01 GMT and the first flights took off from Heathrow at 08:51. All UK visitors over 18 have to provide proof of vaccination to enter the US. American travellers have been able to travel to the UK since 28 July. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has called this a ""significant moment"" for UK-US travel. Transatlantic flights, he added, are ""at the heart of UK aviation"".In addition to the UK, the travel ban is being lifted for people from Brazil, China, India, Ireland, South Africa, Iran and the Schengen countries - a group of 26 European nations.Until Monday, only US citizens, residents and a small selection of other exempt groups have been allowed entry to the US from the UK. The new rules apply to all individuals that have received vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and vaccines Listed for Emergency Use (EUL) by the World Health Organization. The White House's assistant press secretary, Kevin Munoz, confirmed on 15 October that double vaccinated foreign nationals would be able to visit the US from 8 November. The UK has been on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s highest risk category for Covid, level 4 or ""very high"" since 19 July.The CDC said that vaccines approved by the US FDA and WHO's EUL vaccines will be accepted. Therefore, travellers that have received one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two doses of the following vaccines will be allowed to enter the US:Travellers must provide proof of vaccination via their vaccine passport. Certificates including the NHS Covid Pass are accepted. As well as being double vaccinated, travellers will have to provide proof of either a negative Covid test result - taken no more than three days before travelling - or show that they have recovered from the virus in the previous three months.Children are exempt from the vaccination requirement, but all those aged between two and 17 will have to take a Covid-19 test three to five days after arrival.Fully jabbed American visitors travelling to the UK need to take a test on or before the second day of their arrival. Most of the UK's population has received both doses of the Covid vaccine, but the global picture is quite different.After a difficult 21 months, airlines have increased UK-US flight schedules to meet the higher demand. To celebrate the end of the travel ban, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic had a synchronised departure at 08:51 GMT from London Heathrow.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, BA chief executive, Sean Doyle said: ""We must now look forward with optimism, get trade and tourism back on track and allow friends and families to connect once again.""According to travel data firm Cirium, 3,688 flights are scheduled to operate between the US and the UK in November. This is an increase in 21% on October. But it remains 49% down on the pre-pandemic levels of November 2019.Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, told BBC World News that ensuring everyone has the correct documentation will make the upcoming months ""a little choppy"". He said that ""there may be some long lines"" at airports and he has asked travellers to ""have some patience"".Mr Bastian said that although the industry does not expect travellers to have problems with their documentation, they are ready for it. According to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, around 3.8 million British nationals visited the US every year prior to the pandemic.One woman who had not seen her parents, brother or sister in nearly two years as they live in California, said the ban had been a ""nightmare"" for her family.Nadine Beasley missed the weddings of both her siblings, which had been scheduled to take place at the same time so she could attend with her husband and nine-year-old daughter.""Obviously the pandemic scuppered that,"" she told BBC Breakfast.Unfortunately for Mrs Beasley, her brother's wedding took place in May and her sister's was just over a week before the ban was lifted.She has finally been able to book a flight to December to see them, but said the opening up of travel left her with with mixed feelings, as it felt a bit ""too late for us"".Mrs Beasley said: ""I bawled my eyes out and I think it was a mixture of elation and also frustration and honestly a bit of grief.""Grieving the loss of knowing I've missed out on massive life events with everybody.""Before travelling, fully jabbed passengers entering the UK no longer have to take a Covid test before travelling.

140,"Brexit: UK-EU trade deal could collapse over NI row, says Coveney","The UK's trade deal with the EU could collapse in a row over Northern Ireland, says a senior Irish minister.The UK is thought to be preparing to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response.He said: ""One is contingent on the other so that if one is being set aside there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU.""Northern Ireland is covered by a special Brexit deal known as the Protocol.It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which prevents a hard border with Ireland and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.But it also creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is causing difficulties for some businesses.Article 16 of the Protocol allows parts of the deal to be suspended if it is causing serious problems - the UK says that threshold has been reached.The EU has proposed operational changes to the Protocol but the UK is demanding more far-reaching changes.Mr Coveney said that if the UK did suspend parts of the Northern Ireland deal it would be ""deliberately forcing a breakdown in relationships and negotiation between the two sides"".He linked that to the wider UK-EU deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).Either side can give 12 months notice that they intend to terminate the TCA.Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade.The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately.But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market.The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first.Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal.Last week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking and Simon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday.Read more: What is Article 16 and why does it matter?On Sunday Mr Coveney said the ""messages"" that he was getting from political parties in Northern Ireland, the European Commission and others was that London was preparing to trigger Article 16 after the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.He told Irish national broadcaster RTÉ that such a move would be a ""significant act that would damage relationships between Britain and Ireland"".""I think all the evidence now suggests that the British government are laying the foundations to trigger Article 16,"" Mr Coveney said.""That is a worry - I think we need not to be naïve in terms of what's happening.""The minister said the UK was deliberately asking for ""what they can't get"".Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said suspending parts of Northern Ireland's Brexit deal would not resolve the dispute between the UK and EU.The Labour leader told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show he wanted to see ""both sides sitting down and resolving this"".""There's a little bit of me, I am afraid, that can't help think that the prime minister is constantly trying to pick a fight on things like this so he hopes people don't look elsewhere in the forest, which are things like the Owen Paterson affair,"" Sir Keir said.Asked if he would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal to mitigate any impact on economic growth, Sir Keir said he would not rip up the deal but there were ""sensible adjustments"" that could be made to improve the arrangement.""I think we need to make Brexit work... in order to do that, we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in the current arrangements.""The Labour leader said he would do ""whatever I could to make it easier for British firms to trade across the world, but particularly with the EU"".""What I'm not talking about is re-joining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - nobody wants to be in that place.""Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said on Saturday that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol would be ""colossally stupid"".Meanwhile, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has warned the UK government that suspending parts of the protocol could endanger the wider Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU.On the prospect of the UK triggering Article 16, Ms McDonald said: ""It would demonstrate just again colossal bad faith and demonstrate again that Ireland, the north of Ireland in particular, is collateral damage in the Tory Brexit as they play games and play a game of chicken with the European institutions.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/25D6/production/_121468690_89c3224f-3b2f-4466-8311-1a5dd307e11f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59198125,80,2021-11-07T21:41:58.000Z,entertainment

Millions of Australians are also now able travel abroad freely. SAA is made up of Australian firms IFM Investors, QSuper and AustralianSuper and US-based Global Infrastructure Partners.The agreement still needs to clear several more hurdles until it can be completed, including an independent report on the takeover.It also requires approval from three quarters of the airport's shareholders, as well as the greenlight from Australian regulators.Sydney Airport's board said that it plans to hold meetings about the deal in the first quarter of 2022.Shares in the the company rose by 2.8% in Sydney Stock Exchange trading on Monday.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0467/production/_121472110_gettyimages-1350520772.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59202196,80,2021-11-08T05:40:48.000Z,entertainment
142,New York gears up for tourists' return as US lifts ban,"The ice rinks are opening, the decorations are going up and the Thanksgiving day parade will be back in its full glory this year.New York is getting ready to embrace tourists with open arms after 20 months of a strictly long-distance relationship.But visitors are also being warned that prices will be higher, menus more limited, even the toilet paper may not be as soft as you'd like.Welcome to travel in the wake of Covid.Before Covid, 65 million tourists were rolling into town every year, more than a million from the UK.With the ban on visitors from overseas now lifted - as long as they are vaccinated - businesses across New York are gearing up for what they hope will be a tsunami of tourists this winter. But behind the scenes things are still far from normal.""Cutlery, plateware, glassware, take-out containers, paper products… you name it, it's across the board, even toilet paper,"" says Philippe Massoud, listing the things that are difficult to get hold of thanks to supply chain challenges.He is chef and owner of Ilili, a Lebanese restaurant on 5th Avenue.At a certain standard of venue, things like matching tableware and the right specification of toilet tissue matter, says Mr Massoud. ""Sandpaper"" is not okay, he says.Like the UK, the US is suffering supply chain bottlenecks, sharply rising prices and staffing shortages that are hampering day-to-day business.""New York's heart is beating hard and strong,"" says Mr Massoud, so he's sure tourists will still have the experience they're looking for, but for dining out, they should definitely book ahead.Ilili has already had to close at lunchtimes. Many of the staff who used to work tables while pursuing careers on Broadway have left the city and not yet returned.""Everybody without exception is struggling to find staff,"" says Mr Massoud.And with the cost of food rising, he says he has no choice but to look at raising his prices too.Ilili is adapting to cope. But not everyone managed to. Just as in other cities around the world, the pandemic has forced hotels, nightclubs, restaurants, bars and sandwich shops out of business. But now new venues are beginning to open, including a vast new nightclub near Times Square.In fact it's a moment of reinvention, that New York is grasping with enthusiasm, according to Fred Dixon, head of NYC & Co the body responsible for promoting the city.He points to the outdoor dining structures lining much of the city's streets, providing ventilated, safer spaces to dine.After Covid ripped mercilessly through the city at the start of the pandemic, New Yorkers remain cautious. People wear masks not only on public transport and in shops, but often on the street too. Proof of vaccination is required to dine indoors at restaurants in New York, attend sports events and theatres, a rule that applies to tourists too. ""There are challenges ahead of us but some of those innovations have kept New York lively and vibrant,"" says Mr Dixon.From the time the first lockdown his organisation determined to keep NYC alive in the minds of would-be travellers stuck at home in lockdown. It ran a ""New York is missing you"" billboard campaign in the UK, to remind them what they were missing.Now with museums open, rules relaxed and Broadway set to return to full capacity by spring, NYC &Co is switching messages to ""New York is ready for you"".But being ready is harder work than it used to be and visitors may have to exercise some patience, says Wilson Tang, who runs the 100 year old Nom Wah Tea Parlor, in New York's Chinatown district.Before the pandemic Chinatown attracted hoards of tourists, picking up trinkets, noodles and dumplings. And it was hit earlier and harder than most, thanks in part to rhetoric around ""the China virus"" and the xenophobia that followed.Now there are challenges to getting back to normal that can't be overcome overnight, Wilson says.""The wait [for service] might be longer, we might not have the full menu, the pricing might be more expensive than the last time you were here,"" he warns. ""These are things to take account of as we awake from our Covid slumber.""Nearby Lizy Yee, who runs the Kam Hing Bakery has managed to keep the price of her sponge cakes low for now, but is frantically stockpiling ingredients to head off rising costs.""We're trying to get three to four months of reserve,"" she says.""We're using basements, renting out storage rooms."" She has already bought fifty 50lb bags of sugar and wants to bulk buy flour and flavourings too. The hunt for alternative suppliers and better deals is ongoing.At the luxury end of the market, they're taking a similar strategy.Rebecca Hubbard general manager of the five star Lotte New York Palace Hotel says she's ""elated"" at the prospect of returning tourists, but like others she's not taking chances.The hotel is making sure it is more than fully stocked with anything that might run short, if supply chain bottlenecks continue.""We're preparing for the worst, continuing to keep our [stock] levels up just in case,"" Ms Hubbard says.""Shampoo, toilet paper, linen, paper products, glassware anything guests would normally use in a room.""On top of that the hotel needs a ready supply of masks. They are one of things that have run short in the past, and are susceptible to shipping delays as they're still mainly sourced from Asia.Mitchell Hochberg, president of Lightstone the property company that owns the Moxy chain of hotels says for the moment supply chain problems seem to be getting worse not better, though he insists that won't affect visitors' experience.""A guest wouldn't know it's a different shampoo or that the air con unit part was bought from a different manufacturer,"" he says. But there are some changes. ""We instituted self-service check-in... like in an airport,"" says Mr Hochberg. ""It was well-received and seems to be something that will continue for simplicity.""Moxy Hotels are offering guests the option to have less frequent room-cleaning, every three days rather than daily, if they prefer, for health and safety reasons, not to have staff coming into their room as often.And for now breakfast is still a takeaway bag of muffin, croissant, yoghurt and the like, rather than a hot buffet, also for Covid-safety reasons, he says.Having to find ways round the challenges has its upsides though too. At Midtown Manhattan wine bar Ardesia, it has proved a blessing in disguise.Mandy Oser, has found an order of white wine from Hungary is stuck in a port in Germany, a favourite Irish whiskey brand won't be available again until Christmas, and George Clooney's Casamigos Tequila is nowhere to be found. So she has been forced to find alternatives.Amongst her new discoveries are an ""outstanding"" new artisan tequila and a brand of bourbon made by an African-American owned company in Tennessee.""For us it's opened up some new channels and pushed us to look rather than just reorder what we ordered a year ago.""Covid taught us you do not know what is around the corner. We're trying to hold on to that.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12698/production/_121461457_gettyimages-1287989181.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59140960,80,2021-11-08T00:00:57.000Z,entertainment
143,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

144,"How will the US deal with a shortage of 80,000 truckers?","In an empty car park on the outskirts of New York, instructors at Sunny Truck Driving School put students through their paces.They are training a new generation of lorry drivers, more commonly called truck drivers in the US, to help fill the gaps in a nationwide driver shortage - a situation that is adding to the country's supply chain problems. This shortage of drivers is not new, but an increase in freight demand as the US economy reopened after lockdowns, waves of baby boomer retirements and the pandemic have made it worse.The American Trucking Associations (ATA) estimates that the US is short 80,000 truckers - an all time high for the industry. And if nothing changes, the shortfall could reach 160,000 over the next decade.The lack of drivers has made it hard to get products from ports to shop shelves and is driving up prices for a wide variety of products ahead of the winter holidays.  Since images of stranded shipping containers on the US West Coast emerged, the Long Island driving school - that's been around for more than 25 years - has seen the number of interested applicants who want to train as truck drivers grow. ""That has attracted people who weren't looking into this industry before,"" says the school's operations manager Tejbir Batth. Waiting times to join its commercial driver's licence courses have tripled - rising from four to 12 weeks.To keep up with demand, the school recently bought three new tractor trailers and has doubled its staff.""It's a very good problem to have in a business, to grow and grow as fast as you can,"" he says.New incentives and a change in circumstances due to the pandemic are enticing people in to train as truck drivers who perhaps weren't interested in the industry before.""I see a lot of folks coming from, you know, grocery stores, from gas stations or even from city cabs,"" says Mr Batth.When New York City shut down at the start of the pandemic, many taxi and ride-hailing drivers were suddenly left with no work.  Some are now moving into trucking, like Muhammad Sohail who is taking classes at Sunny Truck Driving School to obtain his Class A commercial driver's licence. In the parking area, he is learning how to back up the truck and drive it around corners. He sees the trucking industry as a stable means of supporting his family.""There are a lot of jobs, a lot of companies are hiring,"" he says.  A former Uber driver, he hopes to double his income and believes there are lots of opportunities, not least the possibility of one day starting his own trucking business. According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the median pay for a truck driver in America is $47,130 (£34,700) per year. But, desperate for new blood, freight operators are offering better pay and sign-on bonuses - some as high as $10,000 (£7,360). However, the shortage of drivers isn't just a pay issue. Despite the incentives, not enough people want to become truckers. Or if they do, they often don't stick with it.  Turnover in the industry is very high: the average annual turnover rate for long haul drivers at big firms is 90%, according to the American Trucking Associations. Drivers burn out because the job is stressful and comes with big personal sacrifices - such as long periods of time away from family.  Covid has also led some drivers to bring forward their retirement plans. The average age of a truck driver in the US is around 49 years-old.At a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, long haul truck driver, Brandon Whitehead enjoys a break. But often, after a 14-hour drive, finding a place to park can be difficult.""They make us move and we shouldn't be moving our trucks. There are no facilities for us to use,"" he says.Another frustration for this independent fleet owner from Chicago is rising fuel prices. Mr Whitehead, who owns three tractor trailers, says his workload hasn't increased but his costs have.""It affects the bottom line,"" he explains, while waiting times also cut into his income.  Most long haul truckers are paid by the mile, not by the hour. This means he routinely waits four to six hours to load or unload at shipping facilities.""And then that way now your day is over and you're late on the load and your pay is docked,"" he says.When he first got behind the wheel eight years ago, Mr Whitehead was under no illusion how tough the job was. His grandfather and two uncles were truckers before him. Still, he understands why so many drivers end up leaving the business.  The schedule often means long hours on the road, with extended periods of time away from family. A father of five, he is only at home for four to six days a month.""It's equivalent to being in the army because we're doing a service to America,"" he says. ""Without the recognition, without the pride, without the respect and without the money.""The current crisis shows how heavily the US relies on these unsung key workers.To help increase the number of available drivers, President Biden's infrastructure bill would let drivers as young as 18 drive a truck across state lines. - currently a driver has to be 21.Over time the hope is this would significantly increase the workforce.Increased focus on supply chain woes is leading to changes in America's trucking industry but they are not happening fast enough to reverse the current shortage of drivers.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/106A2/production/_121443276_truckerroadgettyimages-976208144.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59136957,80,2021-11-08T00:04:55.000Z,entertainment
145,New ways into the lucrative world of data science,"What is a data scientist? The job title sprang out of nowhere as technology firms have scrambled to find people to perform sophisticated analytical tasks over the last decade. Reports of six-figure salaries abounded as businesses competed for staff to slice and dice data in pursuit of business lessons and emerging trends.Recruitment firm PageGroup cites annual salaries for data science work of between £60,000-150,000, while cautioning that the job title covers a huge range of disciplines and responsibilities. The line has become blurred between data science and other tasks such as data analysis. James Hobson, a technology specialist at PageGroup notes that ""there are different interpretations of what constitutes a data scientist"".Whatever the title, demand for staff has outstripped the supply of those traditionally considered suitable to the work, usually candidates with doctorates in computer science.A 2020 report into emerging jobs in the US by LinkedIn estimated that data science vacancies were growing at 37%  a year. So new entrants are coming into the field from unorthodox routes, aided by new software packages. Edward Green and Balraj Oates are two of those, although they both hesitate over the data scientist label. For Mr Green, his data science journey began at 15 when he embarked on series of extended stays in London's Great Ormond Street Hospital while being treated for a complex medical problem that required three bouts of surgery over two and a half years. Most of us would prefer to forget such an ordeal. But Mr Green remembers it as his gateway to a career working with technology. ""The day I had my first surgery was the day the iPad was released,"" he says. He joined the hospital's patient council and began capturing medical data on an iPad so it could be displayed to patients. This experiment saw him head straight into IT from school. His surgeon had worked with McLaren, studying the application of F1 pit stop techniques to the movement of patients in and out of intensive care. So motor racing - and work at McLaren's technology centre just outside London where data from cars are analysed - was his next step. At McLaren he uses data science software from US firm Alteryx that has developed its own self-service tool which can help people to become data experts.For Mr Green, it trained him to juggle vast quantities of data. In McLaren's case that means 1.5 terabytes worth collected from every race.  ""Sometimes the drivers feel they don't need this data, but they do,"" he says.More Technology of BusinessEuan Davis researches the future of work at Cognizant, a technology services group. He says that perceptions of the field have changed.""Data science used to be a very dry job. It was seen as nerdy but now it's creative. Communication matters because you have to sell what you uncover and that means telling stories around data."" The future belongs to people with soft skills just as much as to those who master hard data analysis, he says. ""The data science position is becoming a hybrid role. Now it's about being a trusted advisor. The data scientist has to be able to read the data in a way that tells something important to business executives.""Data visualisation tools, software that translates complex information into simple images, have changed the data science game, says Mr Davis: ""The tools are getting easier to use and more intuitive.""Various data analysis businesses such as Tableau and Cloudera offer this type of program, translating information into simple charts and icons for data scientists and others. This approach recognises that not everyone is comfortable trying to extract clear information from the bewildering columns of figures that appear in large spreadsheets. This new technology has created a grey area between the work of a data scientist and data analyst.Traditionally a data analyst might spend more time on routine analysis and providing regular reports. A data scientist would be responsible for the way data is manipulated. Mr Davis thinks this technology will prove reassuring in an era when ""our jobs are changing around machines and we have to understand data"".  Data science represented a dramatic change of direction for Balraj Oates.She was introduced to the discipline via a competitive event, a hackathon where players analysed global Covid case data to create regional comparisons of the pandemic. Alteryx software allowed her to drag and drop icons representing data sets such as death rates.Importantly, by manipulating icons rather than pages of calculations she could match the speed of analysis of a statistician on her team. She compares working with data science tools to using a calculator. This, she says, ""started my data journey"". It propelled her back into the working world after a 12-year break raising three children.Mrs Oates spotted the hackathon on the Women Returners website, which helps professionals returning to work after an extended career break.She mentioned her data science experience to another mother at her children's school who turned out to be seeking a data development specialist. Mrs Oates now applies her new-found knowledge in the financial services industry while her eldest child studies coding. ""It's never too late to think about developing a career and it's more accessible than you think"" Mrs Oates says, before adding how important it is to market yourself.

It was a secure, well-paid, office role, but he found that his enthusiasm was dwindling.""My body was restless from sitting all day, but I was mentally exhausted,"" he says, looking back. ""I became stressed and wired. I'd go to bed at 2am, and not want to get up in the morning.""When the lockdown was announced, Mr Rochefort found himself confined to his home. ""Suddenly, I had no interaction with my co-workers, which I realised was the main reason I was doing the job.""So, I quit with no plan at all... but I knew I wanted to leave the screen behind.""Realising that he would like to get a job working outdoors, Mr Rochefort started volunteering at a wetland wildlife reserve. The site in question - Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire - is owned and run by the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust.After six months of working for free, while he lived off savings, he was given a paid, entry-level role as an aviculturist (someone who looks after birds). Now a year later, he says he has never looked back.Mr Rochefort has had to take a substantial cut in pay, but he says he has never felt better. ""The change to my income hasn't affected my lifestyle at all, the only differences are my improved happiness and the size of mortgage I can apply for.""The pandemic has made a great many of us think of following in Mr Rochefort's footsteps, and make a career change, as a number of studies have shown.In the UK, three fifths of UK workers intend to switch to a different job as a result of Covid, according to a report earlier this year by insurance group Aviva. It is a similar picture in the US, where a survey from last month said that half of all workers wanted to make a change in career. Some commentators have called it ""the great resignation"".Mr Rochefort is also far from alone in wanting to switch to working in the great outdoors.The UK's Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which helps train the professional gardeners of the future, says that demand for its work-based training programmes has jumped 58% in 2021, the highest rate of increase for decades.Sharnee Gardner is one such RHS horticultural apprentice, after swapping life as a professional model to become a gardener.""I absolutely loved my modelling job - I flew [around] the world - but I was so absorbed in my work that I hardly spent time in nature anymore,"" says the 23-year-old.Covid travel bans meant Ms Gardner could no longer go abroad for modelling work from her home in London, so she decided it was time for a change.Now, Ms Gardner, who grew up in Australia, is studying horticulture at RHS site Garden Wisely in Surrey, where she spends her time cutting lawns, pruning trees and planting beds.""Working at the RHS has given me an opportunity to slow down and appreciate my surroundings,"" she says. ""I love watching the sunrise over the garden. It's very important to me to do something that makes me happy.The significant decrease in wage was definitely worth it because I love what I do. But to get by, my partner and I got a flat mate, and I still do the occasional modelling job, too.""The RHS has long pointed to research that shows how gardening contributes to a person's wellbeing, lowering stress levels, and helping people feel happier and healthier.And while most gardeners obviously only do it as a hobby, Suzanne Moss, the RHS's head of education and learning, says the pastime has proved to be especially beneficial throughout the pandemic. ""During the lockdowns, people formed new relationships with their gardens.""They were no longer places of weeds and work. They became a refuge.""This sentiment is echoed by Viren Swami, professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University. He is co-author of a report called Emotional Well-Being Under Conditions of Lockdown, which found that people who spent more time outside during the pandemic were happier than those who remained mostly indoors.""Pre-pandemic we know that people were spending more time indoors than ever before in human history,"" says Prof Swami. ""The more time spent outdoors, the more you'll feel the restorative effects. Beyond mental and physical health, being outdoors improves imagination and learning, and increases creativity and the feeling of fulfilment.""Ms Moss adds that the increased interest in becoming a professional gardener comes as the pandemic has highlighted the fragility of nature in general. ""Many people have realised how important it is not only to protect our own health, but the environment's too,"" she says.The horticulture sector is worth £24bn to the UK economy, according to the RHS, which only sees that increasing as firms in all sectors realise the importance of making their outdoor spaces greener.""Horticulture is a specialism that businesses are crying out for,"" says Ms Moss. ""We need people who can help industries adapt for sustainability.""Yet could the increased interest in gardening only be temporary? That is the suggestion of a report earlier this year by University College London.It found that a third of UK people were now doing less gardening and DIY than they were during the first lockdown of 2020. However, this may be because the weather was much better during spring and early summer last year. Lois O'Connell does not let cold temperatures or rain put her off her gardening work. ""It surprised me how much I loved gardening through the winter months,"" said the 29-year-old RHS student.Before the pandemic she was a sales manager for a luxury gin brand. She spent a lot of time sitting at her desk, or driving to and from meetings, which exacerbated the shoulder and back pain she already suffered from. Then Ms O'Connell was put on furlough.""I needed a change,"" she says. ""I started gardening for friends, then got part-time work with a garden maintenance company.""Ms O'Connell is now also working and studying at RHS Garden Wisley. ""When the days are short, it's good to catch all the daylight you can,"" she adds.""I've never felt better. My pain has gone. I feel calm when I'm gardening. This is definitely a change for life.""Back in Gloucestershire, Mr Rochefort says he has never been happier.  ""When I come home from work I'm physically exhausted and grinning from ear-to-ear,"" he says.""It gets to 10pm and I'm out like a light. I've never slept better.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C18F/production/_121315594_20211009_152208.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59132672,80,2021-11-04T00:02:05.000Z,entertainment
147,World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - report,"Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.COP26 ""has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.COP26 is expected to finish this week.The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. So how has the confusion come about?The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure.

149,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

150,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,science
151,Focus on gender as giant puppet takes centre stage,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Tuesday.The inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to the effects of climate change are high on the agenda today. They form a large majority of the world's poor, often depending on small-scale farming for their livelihoods. The UK government is set to announce £165m to tackle climate change while addressing and empowering women to take climate action. And we can expect an appearance from Little Amal, the giant puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, meeting activists from the countries through which she has ""walked"" during a four-month, 8,000km (4,970-mile) journey from the Syrian border.With negotiations in Glasgow at a critical phase, we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists what they wanted to see agreed. Top of their list is a greater commitment to ""net zero"" emissions targets - in other words not increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, produced when we burn coal, oil or gas to generate power) in the atmosphere. As Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London puts it: ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050.""Former US President Barack Obama earned a standing ovation for a speech declaring the world ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a climate catastrophe. He took aim at Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"" and chided Russia and China for their absence, calling on young people to ""stay angry"" while harnessing their frustration to press for political change. However, some activists pointed out the US had failed to honour key pledges made by Mr Obama's administration.Want to shop sustainably but flummoxed by the language around ""eco-friendly"" products? Our business reporter Beth Timmins runs through seven ways to spot ""greenwashing"" - when companies make statements that make them sound more environmentally friendly than they really are.At his home in Shetland, he might be closer to Norway than Glasgow but engineer Rod Read's big idea is one that would doubtless fly with a lot of the delegates.

152,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas.

153,World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - report,"Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.COP26 ""has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.COP26 is expected to finish this week.The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included ""pursuing efforts"" to keep warming under 1.5C.But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,"" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.Climate Action Tracker blames ""stalled momentum"" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated ""acceptable"", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.""If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. So how has the confusion come about?The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.According to the CAT, these goals are giving ""false hope"". Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13965/production/_121492208_untitled6.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59220687,80,2021-11-09T14:01:50.000Z,science
154,Climate change: Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing,"Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out?Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing? The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned.In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car ""cleaned the air"", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading.Ingredients in a product being described as ""natural"", ""organic"" or ""eco-friendly"", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category. Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. ""Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?""Phrases such as ""eco"", ""sustainable"" and ""green"" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim ""100% eco-friendly"". A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation.And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was ""good for the planet"", branding it: ""Your recipe to a healthier planet."" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. Fashion brands may promote clothes made of ""sustainable"" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment. For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions. In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed in 2018 that its paint was ""the most eco-friendly paint on the market"", but failed to highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly.A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting.But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing.""It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air."" He adds: ""The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.""Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact.Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where ""everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions"". Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: ""Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels."" She said: ""Without this action is useless."" Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products.Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. ""If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.""""Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,"" she adds. The ""recyclable"" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle.In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable. In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

155,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,science
156,Focus on gender as giant puppet takes centre stage,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Tuesday.The inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to the effects of climate change are high on the agenda today. They form a large majority of the world's poor, often depending on small-scale farming for their livelihoods. The UK government is set to announce £165m to tackle climate change while addressing and empowering women to take climate action. And we can expect an appearance from Little Amal, the giant puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, meeting activists from the countries through which she has ""walked"" during a four-month, 8,000km (4,970-mile) journey from the Syrian border.With negotiations in Glasgow at a critical phase, we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists what they wanted to see agreed. Top of their list is a greater commitment to ""net zero"" emissions targets - in other words not increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, produced when we burn coal, oil or gas to generate power) in the atmosphere. As Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London puts it: ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050.""Former US President Barack Obama earned a standing ovation for a speech declaring the world ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a climate catastrophe. He took aim at Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"" and chided Russia and China for their absence, calling on young people to ""stay angry"" while harnessing their frustration to press for political change. However, some activists pointed out the US had failed to honour key pledges made by Mr Obama's administration.Want to shop sustainably but flummoxed by the language around ""eco-friendly"" products? Our business reporter Beth Timmins runs through seven ways to spot ""greenwashing"" - when companies make statements that make them sound more environmentally friendly than they really are.At his home in Shetland, he might be closer to Norway than Glasgow but engineer Rod Read's big idea is one that would doubtless fly with a lot of the delegates.

157,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas.

Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said.

""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""  One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB48/production/_121484834_071808108-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59212185,80,2021-11-09T01:21:41.000Z,science
160,Focus on gender as giant puppet takes centre stage,"Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Tuesday.The inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to the effects of climate change are high on the agenda today. They form a large majority of the world's poor, often depending on small-scale farming for their livelihoods. The UK government is set to announce £165m to tackle climate change while addressing and empowering women to take climate action. And we can expect an appearance from Little Amal, the giant puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, meeting activists from the countries through which she has ""walked"" during a four-month, 8,000km (4,970-mile) journey from the Syrian border.With negotiations in Glasgow at a critical phase, we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists what they wanted to see agreed. Top of their list is a greater commitment to ""net zero"" emissions targets - in other words not increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, produced when we burn coal, oil or gas to generate power) in the atmosphere. As Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London puts it: ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050.""Former US President Barack Obama earned a standing ovation for a speech declaring the world ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a climate catastrophe. He took aim at Donald Trump's ""active hostility toward climate science"" and chided Russia and China for their absence, calling on young people to ""stay angry"" while harnessing their frustration to press for political change. However, some activists pointed out the US had failed to honour key pledges made by Mr Obama's administration.Want to shop sustainably but flummoxed by the language around ""eco-friendly"" products?

161,Fossil fuel industry has largest delegation at climate summit,"There are more delegates at COP26 associated with the fossil fuel industry than from any single country, analysis shared with the BBC shows.Campaigners led by Global Witness assessed the participant list published by the UN at the start of this meeting. They found that 503 people with links to fossil fuel interests had been accredited for the climate summit.These delegates are said to lobby for oil and gas industries, and campaigners say they should be banned.""The fossil fuel industry has spent decades denying and delaying real action on the climate crisis, which is why this is such a huge problem,"" says Murray Worthy from Global Witness. ""Their influence is one of the biggest reasons why 25 years of UN climate talks have not led to real cuts in global emissions.""About 40,000 people are attending the COP. Brazil has the biggest official team of negotiators according to UN data, with 479 delegates. The UK, which is hosting the talk in Glasgow, has 230 registered delegates. So what counts as a fossil fuel lobbyist?Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and others who have carried out the analysis define a fossil fuel lobbyist as someone who is part of a delegation of a trade association or is a member of a group that represents the interests of oil and gas companies.Overall, they identified 503 people employed by or associated with these interests at the summit.They also found that:One of the biggest groups they identified was the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with 103 delegates in attendance, including three people from the oil and gas company BP.According to Global Witness, IETA is backed by many major oil companies who promote offsetting and carbon trading as a way of allowing them to continue extracting oil and gas. ""This is an association that has an enormous number of fossil fuel company as its members. Its agenda is driven by fossil fuel companies and serves the interests of fossil fuel companies,"" Mr Worthy said. ""What we seeing is the putting forward of false solutions that appear to be climate action but actually preserve the status quo, and prevent us from taking the clear, simple actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground that we know are the real solutions to climate crisis.""The IETA says it exists to find the most efficient market-based means of driving down emissions. Members include fossil fuel companies but also a range of other businesses.""We have law firms, we have project developers, the guys who are putting clean technology on the ground around the world, they're also members of our association as well,"" says Alessandro Vitelli, an IETA spokesman.""We're not coming to a shuddering halt today and tomorrow, and suddenly there's going to be no emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels.""""There is a process to transition that's under way, and carbon markets are the best way to make sure that transition takes place.""Campaign groups argue that the World Health Organization didn't get serious about banning tobacco until all the lobbyists for the industry were banned from WHO meetings. They want the same treatment for oil and gas companies at COP.""The likes of Shell and BP are inside these talks despite openly admitting to upping their production of fossil gas,"" said Pascoe Sabido of the Corporate Europe Observatory, who were also involved in the analysis. ""If we're serious about raising ambition, then fossil fuel lobbyists should be shut out of the talks.""The BBC asked the UN body responsible for accrediting delegates about its procedures, but has not received a reply.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/919A/production/_121147273_3_fossil_fuel_getty.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484,80,2021-11-08T00:14:06.000Z,science
162,What is COP26 and what was agreed at Glasgow climate conference?,"The UK is hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow - aimed at bringing climate change under control.A number of pledges have already been made, which could change our everyday lives.The world is warming because of emissions from fossil fuels used by humans, like coal, oil and gas. Extreme weather events linked to climate change - including heatwaves, floods and forest fires - are intensifying. The past decade was the warmest on record and governments agree urgent collective action is needed.For COP26, 200 countries have been asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. They already agreed in 2015 to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C - in order to prevent a climate catastrophe.This is what's known as the Paris Agreement. It means countries have to keep cutting emissions until reaching net zero in 2050.There has been a flurry of new announcements, with more expected:What is the announcement?Leaders from more than 100 world countries, representing about 85% of the world's forests, promised to stop deforestation by 2030.Why it matters?Trees can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) - one of the key greenhouse gases adding to global warming. So, ending deforestation is seen as a vital way to tackle climate change. Does it go far enough?Similar initiatives before haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed or monitored. And Indonesia, one of the main signatories, later said the plan was ""unfair"".What is the announcement?A scheme to cut 30% of current methane emissions by 2030 has been agreed by more than 100 countries. Why it matters?Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The majority comes from a range of activities, such as cattle production and waste disposal.Does it go far enough?The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.What is the announcement?More than 40 countries - which include major coal-users including Poland, Vietnam and Chile - agreed to shift away from coal.Why it matters?Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. Although progress has been made in reducing its use, it still produced about 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. Does it go far enough?Some of the world's most coal-dependent countries, including Australia, India, China and the US, haven't signed up. And the agreement doesn't cover other fossil fuels such as oil or gasWhat is the announcement?Some 450 financial organisations, who between them control $130tn, agreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.Why it matters?The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets, and to commit them to providing finance for green technology.Does it go far enough?There is no set definition yet as to what net zero targets actually are. Also, some environmental organisations have said that without a greater commitment to ending fossil-fuel finance, this initiative may amount to little more than a PR exercise. For the most part, any commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. However, there's a hope that as momentum towards net zero accelerates, it will encourage countries to keep up.It would be possible in theory to impose sanctions on countries that don't. But it could also be counter-productive, or see nations withdraw from international agreements. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage every country to stay involved.Top image from Getty Images.

163,Countries must make bold compromises at summit - PM,"Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said.The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit.Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world.About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rally was the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part.The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax.This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action.He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally.""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax.""Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including:The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action.Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. But unless more is done, the planet is already on course to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century.Several countries, as well as UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, want accelerated action on emissions cuts this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive.Experts and climate change campaigners have welcomed the commitments, but argued they need to be delivered on  - warning a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"".Similarly, activists have argued the deal on coal ""falls well short of the ambition needed"", as the ""small print gives countries enormous leeway"" to choose when to phase out the fossil fuel. Mr Johnson said: ""There is one week left for COP26 to deliver for the world, and we must all pull together and drive for the line.""He said nations had brought ""ambition and action to help limit rising temperatures"", and referred to the pledges that have been made during COP26 - including on deforestation and methane emissions.""But we cannot underestimate the task at hand to keep 1.5C alive,"" he added.""Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed.""Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has warned the world is a ""long way off"" where it needs to be to take the ""major steps"" to ensure global warming does not exceed 1.5C.The Labour MP urged the prime minister to personally head up the negotiations in the final days of COP26, rather than engaging in ""empty exhortation and commentary"".He said: ""We have a right to expect him to engage directly in these final days, personally driving these negotiations forward, pushing all the major emitters to do more, delivering the finance required for developing and vulnerable countries and ensuring we have a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive.""He needs to step up with focus, clarity and urgency in the face of the massive task the world faces in the coming days.""COP26 president Alok Sharma said the billions of dollars to restore the natural world that had been promised during the first week of the summit was humanity's ""first line of defence"" against the crisis.He told a news conference in Glasgow on Saturday that if the world reaches global warming of 1.5C above industrial levels, 70% of coral reefs would be lost.  If it gets to 2C, they would all die, he said.Mr Sharma said the UK will provide £500m to protect more than five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create thousands of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America.The UK is also launching a £65m Just Rural Transition support programme to help communities move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production, he added.Activists speaking at Saturday's climate change march in Glasgow included Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate, actor Idris Elba and representatives of indigenous people.Ms Nakate told the crowd: ""The climate and ecological crises are already here. But so are citizens from around the globe.""Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/92FA/production/_121462673_af919aa4-3ac7-482c-a622-55b1c4cba149.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59191376,80,2021-11-07T09:53:26.000Z,science
164,Small scale nuclear to get green light this week,"Reactor designer Rolls-Royce will announce that a consortium of investors will back plans for a new smaller nuclear reactor project. As part of its 10 point green energy plan, the government has already announced it would provide £210m in funding if that could be matched by private capital. An announcement that money has been raised could come as soon as Tuesday.  Around 21% of Britain's electricity supply is provided by nuclear power. The plan is thought to include the construction of an initial four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) based on the technology used in nuclear powered submarines.  These reactors will be capable of generating nearly 500 megawatts of power - three times as much as much as most existing nuclear submarine reactors but more than six times less than the 3.2 gigawatts that the large plant under construction at Hinkley Point will deliver. Hinkley is expected to produce enough power to supply 6 million homes. The investment to be announced on Tuesday is intended to fund the project up to the stage where the reactor design receives approval. No decision has yet been made on how the construction cost will be financed. At an expected ultimate cost of around £2bn each, they should cost less than a tenth of the £20bn each of Hinkley and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.  Industry sources say they hope that these SMRs would be operational within a decade.Advocates of SMRs say their smaller size means they can be built in a controlled factory setting and installed module by module, reducing risk and cost.  These reactors are not expected to be a substitute for another large-scale nuclear plant the government has said it is determined to approve this parliament - but in addition.  The planned locations of these SMRs is not expected to be confirmed this week but industry sources suggest that existing nuclear sites are the obvious candidates.

165,What do the poorest countries want from climate summit?,"Developing countries are the most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change, such as floods, droughts and wildfires. Addressing the needs of less wealthy and smaller countries is vital for the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow, where leaders are being asked to agree on new commitments to tackle climate change. The least developed countries have set out their priorities for negotiations. They want richer and developed countries to:There is deep frustration among the leaders of developing nations that the richest in the world have not met their previous commitments. Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said: ""Before making new pledges, start by fulfilling the existing ones.""Developing countries have historically contributed a very small proportion of the damaging emissions that drive climate change - and currently the richest 1% of the global population account for more than twice the combined emissions of the poorest 50%.These poorer countries are also more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather because they are generally more dependent on the natural environment for food and jobs, and have less money to spend on mitigation. Over the last 50 years, more than two out of three deaths caused by extreme weather — including droughts, wildfire and floods — occurred in the 47 least developed countries.In 2009, richer countries committed to finding $100bn a year by 2020 from public and private sources, to address the needs of developing countries. The money is to help pay for measures to reduce dangerous emissions and protect from the effects of extreme weather, such as better flood defence systems and investment in renewable energy sources.However, total commitments had only reached $80bn by 2019, and the $100bn target is now unlikely to be met before 2023.Securing an agreement on how to meet the commitments to developing countries - and potentially go further - is crucial if the world is going to achieve its aim to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C.Arriving in Glasgow for the summit, Malawi's president Lazarus Chakwera said: ""It's not a charity act. So pay up or perish with us.""UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put reaching $100bn as one of his four priorities for the negotiations in Glasgow. He said that richer nations had ""reaped the benefits of untrammelled pollution for generations, often at the expense of developing countries"", and that they have a ""duty"" to support developing nations with technology, expertise and money.""We are negotiating for our survival,"" says Tagaloa Cooper, of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme - an organisation made of up members from Pacific island countries and territories.Rising sea levels make some of these island nations the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but Ms Cooper says a lack of resources means they don't have the ""luxury"" of sending large delegations. ""Some of our most vulnerable will struggle to have a voice, and be heard, in these negotiations.""Navigating Covid-safe travel to the Glasgow conference has been an obstacle for many delegations, particularly the Pacific islands, where infection rates have remained low during the pandemic. Only four Pacific island heads of state are reported to be travelling to the summit, with others being represented by smaller teams and ambassadors.Negotiators staying behind and participating remotely may be disadvantaged by unreliable internet access and time differences. Samoa, for instance, is 13 hours ahead of the UK. Developing countries usually have less of a voice on the international stage, so it helps to form groups or blocks to amplify their cause.The Least Developed Countries group is a 46-nation bloc that includes Senegal, Bangladesh and Yemen and represents one billion people.These countries can create stronger negotiating positions when ""priorities and interests are aligned"", says Sonam Wangdi, the current chairman, from Bhutan. ""This crisis isn't being treated like a crisis. That has to change here in Glasgow,"" he says. If there is to be a final agreement, all 197 UN member states that are signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have to sign.That means the final agreement must be acceptable to both richer and developing countries.World leaders failed to secure a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, partly because a handful of developing countries including Sudan and Tuvalu opposed the final agreement.

166,Climate change: Carbon emissions show rapid rebound after Covid dip,"Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists.The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down.But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year.It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C.This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels.Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: ""What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021.""That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.""This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming.The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry. It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.Prof Corinne Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.""The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown.So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable.Read more about the COP26 summit here.""Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,"" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter.Prof Le Quéré concurred: ""This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.""Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. ""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained. ""But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. ""If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.""At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing.Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/180A9/production/_121337489_gettyimages-96390221.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59148520,80,2021-11-04T00:46:26.000Z,science
167,James Webb: Hubble telescope successor faces 'two weeks of terror',"Engineers like to describe the process of landing a rover on Mars as the ""seven minutes of terror"". That's how long it takes for a robot to come to a standing-stop at the surface of the Red Planet after entering the atmosphere faster than a rifle bullet; and so much has to go right in-between to avoid smashing into the ground.But when it comes to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it's more like ""two weeks of terror"".The successor observatory to the mighty Hubble telescope has been built to see the very first stars to shine in the Universe. These very faint, very distant targets require a huge telescope design, one that is so big it has to be folded to fit inside its launch rocket, and then, once in orbit, unfolded again to begin taking pictures of the cosmos.This unfurling has been called an origami exercise in reverse, where the delicate figure is the size of a tennis court.It all takes place over a period of about 14 days, immediately after the launch in mid-December. It will involve an astonishing symphony of hinges, motors, gears, springs, pulleys and cables - all of which must work on command and to perfection.There are no fewer than 344 ""single point failures"" - critical moments in the timeline where, if the action doesn't occur on cue, the six-tonne telescope cannot achieve the desired configuration, fatally undermining its $10bn mission.The expansion of the five super-thin membranes that will shield Webb's vision from interfering sunlight look particularly tricky. Heart-stopping, to be honest. But there is a quiet confidence in the engineering teams, led by the US space agency (Nasa) and aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman (NG). And that's because they've tested and rehearsed everything, over and over and over again.""The sunshield is like a skydiver's parachute; it needs to be folded perfectly so that it unfolds and deploys perfectly without snags, without any tangles,"" said Northrop Grumman systems engineer Krystal Puga.""To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully.""Webb's drama begins almost as soon as the telescope comes off the top of its European Ariane rocket.First, the solar array must come out. No power, no mission. Then, the high-gain antenna makes its move, enabling two-way communications with the ground. No comms, no commands.But all that's kind of easy compared with what comes next.""When I started in this business about 40 years ago, I remember one of the first lessons I got taught was to avoid deployments on orbit,"" said Mike Menzel, Nasa's lead mission systems engineer on the project.""James Webb cannot avoid the deployments. In fact, James Webb has to perform some of the most complex deployment sequences ever attempted, and these come with many challenges.""What if something goes awry? There are no cameras to show what's occurring when the mechanisms are doing their thing. Part of the reasoning for omitting them is that they wouldn't be much use anyway in the dark shadow that's supposed to be cast by the sunshield.So the teams will be relying on sensor feedback, and if a problem arises, they'll work through their ""fault trees"" until a solution is found.In extremis, it's possible even to give the telescope a bit of a shake to free a mechanism that might have become stuck.""When I say, for instance, shimmy, you're rocking the observatory back and forth,"" explained Alphonso Stewart, Nasa's Webb deployment systems lead.""In terms of a twirl, we basically can spin the observatory about any given axis. And for fire and ice, we can orient the observatory in such a way to put the sun on certain areas to heat them up, if we deem that that's necessary for the deployment,"" he told BBC News.Webb is due to enter service about 180 days after launch, a time period that includes tuning the performance of the telescope's mirrors and instruments. But the engineers will not rush their tasks, especially if they come up against a snag.""I've been the Webb project manager for almost 11 years, and this team does not give up,"" said Bill Ochs.""So, we don't talk about what do we do if we fail? We talk about how we correct problems that we see on orbit, and how we move forward from there.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/64/cpsprodpb/3E76/production/_112909951_jonathanamos.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59138682,80,2021-11-03T00:05:34.000Z,science
168,Signs of first planet found outside our galaxy,"Astronomers have found hints of what could be the first planet ever to be discovered outside our galaxy.Nearly 5,000 ""exoplanets"" - worlds orbiting stars beyond our Sun - have been found so far, but all of these have been located within the Milky Way galaxy.The possible Saturn-sized planet discovered by Nasa's Chandra X-Ray Telescope is in the Messier 51 galaxy.This is located some 28 million light-years away from the Milky Way.This new result is based on transits, where the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and yields a characteristic dip in brightness that can be detected by telescopes.  This general technique has already been used to find thousands of exoplanets.Dr Rosanne Di Stefano and colleagues searched for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from a type of object known as an X-ray bright binary. These objects typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. The material near the neutron star or black hole becomes superheated and glows at X-ray wavelengths.Because the region producing bright X-rays is small, a planet passing in front of it could block most or all of the rays, making the transit easier to spot.The team members used this technique to detect the exoplanet candidate in a binary system called M51-ULS-1.""The method we developed and employed is the only presently implementable method to discover planetary systems in other galaxies,"" Dr Di Stefano, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US, told BBC News.""It is a unique method, uniquely well-suited to finding planets around X-ray binaries at any distance from which we can measure a light curve.""This binary contains a black hole or neutron star orbiting a companion star with a mass about 20 times that of the Sun. A neutron star is the collapsed core of what had once been a massive star.The transit lasted about three hours, during which the X-ray emission decreased to zero. Based on this and other information, the astronomers estimate that the candidate planet would be around the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance Saturn lies from the Sun.Dr Di Stefano said the techniques that have been so successful for finding exoplanets in the Milky Way break down when observing other galaxies. This is partly because the great distances involved reduce the amount of light which reaches the telescope and also mean that many objects are crowded into a small space (as viewed from Earth), making it difficult to resolve individual stars.With X-rays, she said, ""there may be only several dozen sources spread out over the entire galaxy, so we can resolve them.  In addition, a subset of these are so bright in X-rays that we can measure their light curves.""Finally, the huge emission of X-rays comes from a small region that can be substantially or (as in our case) totally blocked by a passing planet.""The researchers freely admit that more data is needed to verify their interpretation.One challenge is that the planet candidate's large orbit means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, quashing any attempts to make a follow-up observation in the near-term.One other possible explanation that the astronomers considered is that the dimming has been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source.However, they think this is unlikely, because the characteristics of the event do not match up with the properties of a gas cloud.""We know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully,"" said co-author Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University, New Jersey. ""We think we have a strong argument, and this process is how science works.""Dr Di Stefano said that the new generation of optical and infrared telescopes would not be able to compensate for the problems of crowding and dimness, so observations at X-ray wavelengths would likely remain the primary method for detecting planets in other galaxies.However, she said a method known as microlensing might also hold promise for identifying extra-galactic planets.The study has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Astronomy.Follow Paul on Twitter.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15497/production/_121219178_eso0836a.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59044650,80,2021-10-25T19:49:57.000Z,science
169,Blue Origin: Jeff Bezos unveils plans for 'space business park',"Blue Origin, the space tourism company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to launch a commercial space station. Bosses said on Monday that they hope to operate the station, named ""Orbital Reef,"" by the end of the decade. Promotional material released by the company claims the station will be a ""mixed-use business park"" in space and will host up to 10 people. The company will partner with Sierra Space and Boeing to build the outpost.Blue Origin said the 32,000 sq ft station would provide customers with an ideal location for ""film-making in microgravity"" or ""conducting cutting-edge research"" and said it would also include a ""space hotel"".At a press conference to launch the initiative, executives from Blue Origin and Sierra Space declined to give an estimate of the building costs, though the project seems assured of heavy funding from Mr Bezos, who has committed to spending $1bn (£726m) a year on Blue Origin. The announcement comes as Nasa searches for proposals to replace the 20-year-old International Space Station (ISS). While funding for the station has been guaranteed until at least 2030, the outpost is in desperate need of repairs. Russian officials have previously warned that its cosmonauts could leave the station by 2025 over fears outdated equipment could trigger a major incident. In response, Nasa announced plans earlier this year to award $400m in private contracts to space companies to help the agency replace the ageing outpost. However, there is likely to be stiff competition for the funding. Earlier this week, a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin announced its own plans to launch a space station into low orbit by 2027. Blue Origin has faced mixed fortunes so far this year. High-profile launches of its New Shepard rocket, which saw Mr Bezos and Star Trek star William Shatner blasted into space, gained significant media attention. But the company has also faced accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace and of turning a blind eye to serious safety concerns from former employees. Last month it missed out on a lucrative $2.9bn Nasa contract which went to billionaire Elon Musk's Space X, one of Blue Origin's chief rivals in the commercial space race.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/00CA/production/_121220200_blueorigin.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59046076,80,2021-10-26T03:04:48.000Z,science
170,Orion: Nasa's Moon-ship is attached to SLS megarocket,"Nasa's next-generation spaceship has been lifted onto the rocket that will launch it to the Moon this year or in early 2022.On Wednesday, the Orion spacecraft was attached to the powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.For its upcoming flight, Orion will fly around the Moon without astronauts.But it will eventually carry people as part of a US plan to return people to the lunar surface this decade.This programme is called Artemis - after the sister of Apollo - and could help establish a long-term human presence on Earth's only natural satellite.A crane lifted Orion and then lowered it onto the top of the SLS inside the cuboid Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy.Teams then began work to fully secure the spacecraft to its launcher.On Monday, Orion was transferred to the VAB from another facility where it was being housed, ahead of the operation. It was the last significant piece of hardware waiting to be added to the launch system ahead of the planned test flight.In coming weeks, engineers will also carry out tests on the assembled vehicle, including a rehearsal where the SLS rocket is loaded up with liquid fuel while a launch countdown is simulated.The SLS will launch the Orion spacecraft as part of the uncrewed Artemis-1 mission. This three-week flight will test the SLS and Orion before astronauts are allowed aboard for Artemis-2, which will also loop around the Moon in late 2023.Artemis-3 will see astronauts land on the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Nasa has selected Elon Musk's Starship as the vehicle that will carry humans down from lunar orbit to the surface.Orion will dock with Starship in lunar orbit. Astronauts will then float through a hatch from Orion to Starship to begin preparations to travel down to the lunar surface.The landing mission is currently scheduled for 2024, though many observers expect that date to slip.The metal structure for the Orion spacecraft that will be used for that mission also arrived at Kennedy Space Center this month.This flight will carry the first woman to walk on the surface, along with the next man.

171,South Korea launches first homegrown space rocket Nuri,"South Korea has launched its first homegrown rocket, stepping up the country's ambitions in space.The Korean Satellite Launch Vehicle II, known as Nuri, took off from Goheung, about 500km (310 miles) south of Seoul. President Moon Jae-in said the vehicle completed its full flight sequence but failed in its goal of putting a dummy satellite in orbit. Such launches are essential for a space programme but could potentially also have military applications. South Korea is locked in an arms race with North Korea, with both recently test-firing new weapons. The North put a satellite in orbit in 2012. Nuri cost South Korea an estimated 2 trillion won (£1.23bn or $1.6bn) to develop. Weighing 200 tonnes and measuring 47.2 metres long, it is fitted with six liquid-fuelled engines. In his comments, President Moon admitted the launch fell short of their goals, but added: ""It's not long before we'll be able to launch it exactly into the target trajectory,"" Reuters news agency reported. South Korea plans to carry out four more launches of the Nuri until 2027 to increase reliability, according to the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) that is overseeing the launch.While South Korea is seen as a technological powerhouse, it has lagged behind other countries in its development for space exploration.Previous attempts by Seoul to launch a rocket in 2009 and 2010 failed, with the second exploding minutes after take-off. South Korea is aiming to send a probe to the moon by 2030.While South Korea says it intends to use Nuri to launch satellites, the test has also been viewed as part of the country's ongoing ramp-up in weapons development. Ballistic missiles and space rockets use similar technology. South Korea recently tested a submarine-launched missile. It is also hosting what is said to be its largest ever defence exhibition this week, where it will reportedly unveil a new fighter jet and guided weapons like missiles. Meanwhile North Korea has been carrying out a flurry of weapons tests. In recent weeks, it has launched what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons. Earlier this week, North Korea fired its own submarine-launched missile into the Sea of Japan.Some of these tests by Pyongyang violate international sanctions, as the UN prohibits it from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea also recently held its own defence expo where it showcased its military hardware including tanks and missiles.In Asia, China, Japan and India all have advanced space programmes. Private firms, such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, are also increasingly involved in rocket launches.

172,Sir David Attenborough polar ship makes its London debut,"The UK's new polar research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, has completed basic sea trials and is ready to undertake its first expedition.The vessel came up the Thames on Wednesday through the Woolwich Barrier and is now tied up in Greenwich.It is spending a few days at the home of the Prime Meridian to enable the public to see it, but also to mark the start of the COP26 climate conference.World governments meet in the Scottish city of Glasgow from Sunday.The Attenborough, named after the TV naturalist and BBC presenter Sir David, is the ship the public wanted to call ""Boaty McBoatface"" in an online poll but were overruled by ministers. International senior scientific advisers are using the Attenborough as a platform to issue a statement about the urgent need to address the climate crisis.They want to see a concerted drive to develop - and use - the technologies that will keep global temperature rise to1.5C and underpin the net zero economies of tomorrow.These technologies include better ways of creating, storing and using low-emissions energy - including improving semiconductors, batteries and low-emitting fuel production - as well as work on heating and cooling, and carbon capture and storage.""I think the first thing to say is sticking to 1.5 is both important and achievable,"" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told BBC News.  ""But it's only achievable if we get urgent action. If you work back, for example, from 2050, and ask what you need to do, you can't rely on something coming along late in the day and saving us. It's about utilising the technologies we have now, getting them in place as soon as we can at scale. And that in itself requires R&D (research and development), and making sure that we use both technology, and, of course, natural actions, and the behavioural changes that we all need to take.""  The 129m-long Attenborough has spent the past year in shake-down trials around the British coast.Its first ocean voyage will go to Antarctica for the new austral summer research season.The vessel must deliver supplies to the UK's main scientific base, at Rothera, on the continent's peninsula, as well as to other minor stations dotted around the Southern Ocean.It is expected to head south on or around 18 November.Engineers will want to check its performance in sea-ice, something they haven't had the chance to do.The Attenborough is what's termed a Polar Class 4 icebreaker, which means it should have the strength to crash through metre-thick floes at a steady pace and without damage to its hull.The £200m ship is state of the art. It has a helipad (helicopters are essential for exploration and safety), cranes and onboard labs, and it has an enhanced ability to deploy subs and other ocean-survey and sampling equipment.The Attenborough was the product of lessons learned after decades of operations in the frozen south and north, said Dr Rob Larter.""The way science has progressed means you now have to be able to handle much bigger gear. So, that's why this ship has these very big cranes and gantries,"" the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) marine geophysicist told BBC News.""You also need to be very flexible, because there's so many different sorts of science that people want to do now. We have laboratories that come in containers, like for example a radioisotope lab, an ultra-clean chemistry lab and an experimental aquarium. These can all be added to the ship."" The Attenborough will be at the forefront of understanding how Earth's atmosphere and oceans are warming, and the impacts the temperature rise will have, in particular, on the ice-covered waters and lands of the Arctic and Antarctic.Sir David was present on Thursday to inspect his namesake.His hope, he said, was that world leaders meeting at COP26 would listen to the science and take action to curb global warming. ""I am indeed a very proud man to be standing in this remarkable vessel, to be associated in any way with best, the British Antarctic Survey,"" he told his audience.""May I wish this ship and all who sail in her, and all the scientists who research on board, bon voyage on her forthcoming voyage to the Antarctic. I know that the findings made on this ship in the next few years will be of the greatest value and importance to the welfare of the world. Let us listen to the science.""BAS scientists have already established, for example, how the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, actually helps to shield us from the worst effects of global heating. Oceanographer Dr Emma Boland explained: ""The Southern Ocean takes up about 40% of the carbon dioxide that the oceans as a whole take up, even though it only accounts for 20% of the total ocean surface area. So, it's doing double the work. ""And if that CO2 didn't get taken up by the ocean, it'd be in the atmosphere, and global warming at the surface as we experience it, as human beings, would be that much worse.""The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Scientists have even calculated a value for this ""service"" provided by the Southern Ocean: £60bn per year (€72bn/yr). In other words, if the Southern Ocean didn't exist, this is how much it would cost to remove the CO2 from the atmosphere in a different way.The new Royal Research Ship is tied up to a pontoon in the Thames a short distance from the famous 19th-Century tea clipper, the Cutty Sark.The public won't be able to board the Attenborough, but they will be able to visit an associated exhibition hosted by the Royal Museums Greenwich called ""Ice Worlds"". This will showcase live virtual tours of the polar ship on a big screen, alongside a range of interactive stands.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/64/cpsprodpb/3E76/production/_112909951_jonathanamos.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59022676,80,2021-10-28T10:39:30.000Z,science
173,Neutrino result heralds new chapter in physics,"A new chapter in physics has opened, according to scientists who have been searching for a vital building block of the Universe.A major experiment has been used to search for an elusive sub-atomic particle: a key component of the matter that makes up our everyday lives.The search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.This will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.Prof Mark Thomson, the executive chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), which funds the UK's contribution to the Microboone experiment, described the result as ''pretty exciting''.That is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. ''This has been out there for a long time now and generated a lot of interest,'' Prof Thomson told BBC News.''The result is really interesting because it has an influence on emerging theories in particle physics and cosmology.''The Microboone experiment is based at the US Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois - just outside Chicago. But physicists from many countries are involved with the project.Neutrinos are ghostly sub-atomic particles that permeate the Universe, but barely interact with the everyday world around us. Each second, billions of them pass right through the Earth - and everyone living on it.Neutrinos come in three known types, or flavours - the electron, muon and tau. In 1998, Japanese researchers discovered that neutrinos changed from one flavour to another as they travelled.This flavour-flipping cannot fully be explained by the current ""big theory"" of sub-atomic physics - called the Standard Model. Some physicists believe that finding out why the neutrino has such a tiny mass - which is what allows them to change flavour - will give them a deeper understanding of how the Universe works and specifically how it came into being.Current theories suggest that, shortly after the Big Bang, there were equal amounts of matter and its shadowy mirror-image anti-matter. However, when matter collides with anti-matter, they violently annihilate each other, releasing energy.  If there were equal amounts in the early Universe, they should have cancelled each other out.Instead, most of the Universe today is made of matter, with much smaller amounts of anti-matter.Some scientists believe that, contained within the neutrino's flavour-changing, is the cosmic sleight-of-hand that enabled some matter to survive after the Big Bang and create the planets, stars and galaxies that make up the Universe.In the 1990s, an experiment called the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment at the US Department for Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico saw the production of more electron neutrinos than could be explained by the three-neutrino flavour-flipping theory. That result was confirmed by a separate experiment tin 2002.Physicists proposed the existence of a fourth flavour called the sterile neutrino. They believed this form of the particle could explain the over-production of electron neutrinos and, crucially, give an insight into why the particles change flavour. They were named sterile neutrinos because they are predicted not to interact with matter at all, whereas other neutrinos can - though very rarely. Detecting a sterile neutrino would have been a bigger discovery in sub-atomic physics than the Higgs boson because, unlike other forms of neutrino and the Higgs particle, it is not part of the current Standard Model of physics. A team involving nearly 200 scientists from five countries developed and built the Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment, or Microboone, in order to find it. Microboone consists of 150 tonnes of hardware in a space that's the size of a lorry.Its detectors are highly sensitive: its observations of the sub-atomic world have been likened to looking in ultra-high definition.The team has now announced that four separate analyses of data gathered by the experiment show ""no hint"" of the sterile neutrino. But this result is not so much the end of the story, but the beginning of a new chapter.Dr Sam Zeller from Fermilab says that the non-detection does not have to contradict previous findings. ""The earlier data doesn't lie,"" she said.""There's something really interesting happening that we still need to explain. Data is steering us away from the likely explanations and pointing toward something more complex and interesting, which is really exciting.""Prof Justin Evans, from the University of Manchester, believes that the puzzle posed by the latest findings marks a turning point in neutrino research. ""Every time we look at neutrinos, we seem to find something new or unexpected,"" he said. ""Microboone's results are taking us in a new direction, and our neutrino programme is going to get to the bottom of some of these mysteries.""Follow Pallab on Twitter",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ABBB/production/_121236934_machine.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59051779,80,2021-10-27T16:46:12.000Z,science
174,Sitting Bull: DNA confirms great-grandson's identity,"A sample of hair belonging to the legendary 19th century Native American leader Sitting Bull has allowed scientists to confirm that a South Dakota man is his great-grandson.Scientists took DNA from a tiny sample of Sitting Bull's hair that had been stored in Washington DC.It showed that Ernie LaPointe, 73, is his great-grandson.The new method allows analysis of family lineages with DNA fragments from long-dead people.It opens the door to the prospect of matching other historic figures to their living descendants.""I feel this DNA research is another way of identifying my lineal relationship to my great-grandfather,"" Mr LaPointe, who has three sisters, told the Reuters news agency.""People have been questioning our relationship to our ancestor as long as I can remember. These people are just a pain in the place you sit - and will probably doubt these findings, also."" The new method was developed by scientists led by Eske Willerslev, director of the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the University of Cambridge.The novel technique is based on what is known as autosomal DNA in the genetic fragments extracted from the hair. It took 14 years to perfect the method. Mr Willerslev said he had been fascinated by Sitting Bull since he was a child and offered his services to Mr LaPointe around a decade ago. Sitting Bull's scalp lock was repatriated to Mr LaPointe by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in 2007. But before handing over the lock, Mr LaPointe asked Mr Willerslev to take part in a ceremony involving a medicine man, drummers and chanting, where Sitting Bull's spirit gave his blessing to the study, the scientist told the AFP news agency.Mr LaPointe burned the majority of the lock - in line with the spirit's instructions - leaving the researchers with just 4cm, which Mr Willerslev believed was ""disastrous"" at the time. However, this forced the team to develop their innovative new method, he said. Sitting Bull, whose real name was Tatanka Iyotake, famously led 1,500 Native American warriors at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, wiping out US General Custer and five companies of soldiers.He was shot dead in 1890 by the ""Indian Police"" acting on behalf of the US government.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14B11/production/_121235748_mediaitem121235747.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59062133,80,2021-10-28T07:51:01.000Z,science
175,Glastonbury Festival 2022: Diana Ross coming back to play legend slot,"Soul icon Diana Ross has confirmed she'll play Glastonbury's coveted ""legend slot"" in 2022.The Motown star was originally due to make her debut at the festival in 2020, before the event was called off during the pandemic. After another Covid-enforced cancellation, she'll bring hits like Baby Love and Upside Down to the Pyramid Stage on 26 June.The Sunday teatime slot traditionally draws the event's largest crowds. Dolly Parton's appearance in 2014 attracted Glastonbury's biggest-ever audience; while Kylie Minogue's triumphant set in 2019 became the most-watched Glastonbury performance ever on the BBC, with 3.9 million viewers tuning in.

176,Glastonbury Festival 2022: Diana Ross coming back to play legend slot,"Soul icon Diana Ross has confirmed she'll play Glastonbury's coveted ""legend slot"" in 2022.The Motown star was originally due to make her debut at the festival in 2020, before the event was called off during the pandemic.

177,Quantum Leap actor Dean Stockwell dies aged 85,"Dean Stockwell, the US actor known for playing Al in the sci-fi series Quantum Leap, has died aged 85.During a 70-year career, Stockwell won a Golden Globe award for the his best-known role and was also nominated for an Oscar for Married to the Mob.Aside from Quantum Leap, he also appeared in Air Force One, as well as the David Lynch films Blue Velvet and Dune.His representatives told the BBC he died peacefully at home on Sunday.Quantum Leap originally aired on NBC in the US for five seasons, from 1989 to 1993, and soon became popular with UK audiences too.It starred Scott Bakula as Dr Sam Beckett, a physicist who involuntarily leaps through space time using other people's bodies as vessels in order to correct historical mistakes. Stockwell co-starred as Admiral Al Calavicci, Dr Beckett's cigar-smoking and womanising best friend who appears to him in hologram form to offer guidance as the experiments unfold.""I have a particular fondness for Admiral Al Calavicci,"" Stockwell said in a 1994 interview. ""I guess people say that actors take a little bit of the part away with them, but if I really was as streetwise and cocky as Al, I'd probably have been a bigger star.""He won a Golden Globe award for the role in 1990 - for best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a TV series - and later received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.Last year, NBC announced it was considering a reboot of the show for its streaming service.Born into a family of entertainers in Los Angeles, Stockwell started his career as a child actor and made his first film appearance in 1945's Valley of Decision, before featuring alongside Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh.He then appeared in Broadway stage productions such as Compulsion, later reprising his role in the screen adaptation of the same name.In the mid-1960s though, Stockwell dropped out of showbusiness to join the Topanga Canyon hippie community, where members included the musician Neil Young.""I did some drugs and went to some love-ins,"" Stockwell later said of the experience. ""The experience of those days provided me with a huge, panoramic view of my existence that I didn't have before. I have no regrets.""He returned to Hollywood with roles in Paris, Texas, Dune and To Live and Die in L.A, before putting in a memorable cameo as the crooner Ben in the neo-noir mystery thriller Blue Velvet, where he performed a rendition of Roy Orbison's Dreams for Dennis Hopper and co.In 1988, he was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his performance as Mafia boss Tony ""the Tiger"" Russo in the comedy Married to the Mob. Stockwell called it ""the favourite part I've ever had in a film"". He said: ""I just felt that that part was just perfect for me and I had a way to approach it that I thought was just right and it turned out that way.""He also appeared in Francis Ford Coppella's The Rainmaker, as well as Robert Altman's The Player, and went on to have recurring TV roles in the Battlestar Galactica series and The Tony Danza Show.Stockwell was twice married - once to the actress Millie Perkins - and had two children.A statement from his publicity team read: ""Dean spent a lifetime yo-yoing back and forth between fame and anonymity. Because of that, when he had a job, he was grateful. He never took the business for granted. He was a rebel, wildly talented and always a breath of fresh air. He loved to act, to laugh, smoke cigars and play golf.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

178,Travis Scott festival tragedy: Were warning signs missed at Astroworld?,"For almost 40 minutes after Houston police and firefighters responded to a ""mass casualty"" event at Travis Scott's packed Astroworld music festival on Friday, the superstar continued to perform.By the time he left the stage, it had become one of the deadliest concerts in US history. Eight people died and dozens more were injured. Fans were filmed chanting ""stop the show"" and pleading for staff to help. One even climbed onto a camera platform to point out the injured.Scott eventually ended his set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time. But questions remain about why it didn't finish sooner.""Nine thirty, right there. That's when a few people started going down,"" Houston police chief Troy Finner said at a press conference on Saturday. ""Our people stepped up and immediately went to the producers and told them, 'Hey, we got people going down.' This show ended at 10:10pm. I just wanted to acknowledge that.""Scott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched the event with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. He said in an Instagram video that he was not aware how bad things had become during his headline set this year.""Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need,"" he said. ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.""In footage from the concert, he can be seen interrupting his performance to ask for help for a fan who had passed out.However in another another video, he can be heard saying during another break: ""Who asked you to stop? Y'all know what y'all came to do - chase me, let's go.""The rapper is known for his wild shows, and has been in trouble for inciting dangerous behaviour in the past.In 2015, he was charged with disorderly conduct after encouraging fans in Chicago to ignore security and rush the stage.Two years later, he spotted a fan hanging from a venue's second-storey balcony and tried to persuade them to jump. At the same concert, a 27-year-old fan was paralysed after being pushed off a third-floor balcony.In 2019, hundreds of fans rushed the Astroworld barriers, with three people going to hospital with minor injuries. Police wrote on Twitter that the event was understaffed and that ""promoters did not plan sufficiently for the large crowds"", although the statement was later deleted.Fears about crowd safety had been raised before this year's event. A security plan obtained by the New York Times addressed several areas of concern.""Based on the site's layout and numerous past experiences, the potential for multiple alcohol/drug related incidents, possible evacuation needs, and the ever-present threat of a mass casualty situation are identified as key concerns,"" the document read.Before Scott took to the stage, local news teams filmed fans bursting through gates and bypassing security checkpoints.The city's police chief also visited the star in his dressing room to convey concerns about the energy in the crowd.In a statement, Chief Finner said the ""brief and respectful meeting"" allowed him to ""share my public safety concerns"" and ask the star ""to be mindful of his team's social media messaging on any unscheduled events."" So how could this tragedy happen?Investigators will look at a number of factors, says Simon Ancliffe, founder of Movement Strategies, which advises major UK events like Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds and the 2012 Olympics on crowd safety.""Have they controlled numbers? Are there barriers in place and were they well designed? Were security staff doing what they're supposed to do? Did they have good situational awareness? Did they have CCTV?""They did seem have to some kind of procedure to stop the show, but it seemed to stop and start - so was [the situation] about communications, was it about decision making?""When tragedies occur, he says, it's often not about one bad decision but an accumulation of smaller mistakes that ultimately lead to catastrophe. In this case, ""it sounds like a lot of things went wrong"".""It all comes down to planning,"" says Keith Still, a professor of crowd science at the University of Sussex.""You need to anticipate that this type of performer in that type of environment will induce this type of behaviour in the crowd - and you put crowd management and monitoring systems in place to make sure that you've got an early warning indicator.""Ancliffe says the teams on the ground are not necessarily to blame.""The security staff on the barriers can see what's immediately in front of them, but [only] a few people deep,"" he says, explaining that frontline staff need back-up in the form of CCTV or a more elevated view of the audience.In the UK, ""we have experienced crowd managers with a really good view of the crowd from a raised position, so you can see people's faces and look for the change in expression"", says Eric Stuart, chair of the UK Crowd Management Association. ""There's always going to be people screaming because they're having fun. The skill and the artform is looking at the faces and listening to the screams and saying, 'That's different. Things have changed.'""Many people in an audience often aren't aware of a life-threatening situation until it's too late.""When you're in a crowd, you can't see more than a couple of people in front of you, and you can't hear what's going on because of the music,"" says Ancliffe. ""So there's really bad information transfer within the crowd.""If people are pushing forwards, they can't see what's in front of them. And once you've fallen down, it's very difficult to get up again, unless people are helping you. And if people have bent over to help you, then they can be pushed over very easily as well.""So it's up to staff to identify problems and alert the performer, who can pause the show and calm the situation.In this case, it was the audience who notified security and were ""asking for things to change"", says Ancliffe.""So what was the situational awareness? What was the decision making? There may be other factors involved, but those will probably be the things where the disaster happened.""Some experts have also suggested Scott's decision to play on a separate stage with no other acts scheduled at the same time could have exacerbated the situation.That goes against a common practice in crowd management, known as ""spreading the field"", where organisers arrange several competing headliners or stagger stage times to control the flow of fans.But Scott's performance came 45 minutes after SZA had ended the day's final set on Astroworld's second stage. Fans who had been gathering near the barriers of his $5m ""Utopia Mountain"" arena since lunchtime were suddenly met with an influx of revellers, hyped up by a massive countdown clock heralding the star's arrival.""The crux of the problem likely happened as the clock got close to zero,"" one unnamed source told Variety magazine.One teenage fan said she got into difficulties almost immediately.""Once Travis Scott came on, I told myself this is the moment I've been preparing for, I just need to breathe,"" Diana Amira told NBC news. ""But... my ribcage was so squished that I couldn't expand my lungs to catch a breath.""Thankfully, crowd-related deaths at music events are relatively few and far between.""The first thing to say is that if you have an experienced crowd team on site, it won't reach that stage,"" Eric Stuart tells BBC Radio 5 Live.""If the worst comes to worst, there's a small group of people who have what we call the 'red card', and it is literally a message to the stage manager that we need to cut the music, we need to stop. ""And then we need to engage the artist for him or her to speak to the crowd. Ideally, we don't want a guy or girl in the high-vis jacket or the police coming on stage and talking to the crowd. The artist is the best person to do that.""That seems to have happened during Friday's concert. The question for investigators will be why the music continued after the initial call for help.In his video statement, Scott said he was ""working closely with everyone to get to the bottom of this"" and described himself as ""honestly just devastated"". Steve Adelman, vice president and lead counsel for the Event Safety Alliance, urged against apportioning blame at this stage. ""There is the instinct to rush to judgment before we know what actually happened,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine.Ancliffe hopes an inquiry will encourage promoters to ""tighten up their procedures or [concert] designs"".But Prof Still adds: ""If you look at any other safety-related industry - aviation, for example - if there's a near miss or a close call there's an investigation by experts, and new procedures are put into place to prevent that happening again.""Unfortunately, in the events industry, it comes down to litigation and it's generally settled out of court. I know, because I'm an expert witness in a number of international cases.""The court documents get sealed, the information never gets fed back into the industry and so there's no learning, there's no improvement.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

179,Actors to star in three plays at once for Sheffield Theatres' 50th birthday,"An ambitious new trilogy of plays will ask its actors to sprint between three theatres as they attempt to perform in all three at the same time.Rock/Paper/Scissors is three standalone but connected plays that will be staged simultaneously at the Sheffield Crucible, Studio and Lyceum theatres.The complex's artistic director Robert Hastie said he wanted ""a big challenge"" for its 50th birthday in 2022.""It's going to be a busy time for the actors,"" he said.Whereas an actor will normally wait in their dressing room between scenes, Rock/Paper/Scissors will require them to hot-foot it straight to one of the two neighbouring venues.The stars won't have to run too far, though. The Crucible and Studio are in the same building, while the Lyceum is next door.""The actors won't be going into backstage mode because an exit from one play is an entrance directly into another, with a short sprint between rooms,"" Hastie said.The cast has not yet been announced but Hastie and playwright Chris Bush are currently working out how to ensure the same actors can appear in three plays at the same time.""We've done a lot of spreadsheets and we've done a lot of sprinting between theatres, but until we actually get the actors in rehearsal, there's a lot that we've yet to discover,"" he said.The three parts of Rock/Paper/Scissors will follow three generations of a family exploring what to do with an old scissor manufacturing factory in the Steel City.Even the rehearsal process is a logistical headache. ""We're going to have to set up our rehearsal rooms so the time to get between them is exactly the same as the time to get between the stages,"" Hastie said.""If that timing isn't exactly right, then the whole thing won't work. Even if it means going up an extra staircase and back down another, we'll have to create a route [between rehearsal rooms] that's exactly the same distance as between the stages.""The precision of it will have to be immaculate. Chris is building in some space and some failsafe mechanisms within the scenes, but the whole thing will have to operate like a machine.""Rock/Paper/Scissors will be the centrepiece of Sheffield Theatres' 50th anniversary season, which will also include the return of Bush's collaboration with musician Richard Hawley, Standing at the Sky's Edge.Also following three Sheffield generations, the musical will then transfer to the National Theatre in London.Sheffield Theatres' three auditoria have a total capacity of 2,500 - the same as the National's three venues.""For the rest of the year, all three theatres will be doing very different things, making a really broad, diverse variety of work,"" Hastie said. ""It's just nice in the centre of our anniversary year to bring them together for the first and probably the only time in their history.""Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

180,Tiger King 2: Carole Baskin has 'no claim' to sue over footage - Netflix,"Netflix has said Carole Baskin has ""no claim"" in suing the company over the use of footage of her in Tiger King 2.Baskin and her husband Howard launched legal action against Netflix last week for breach of contract after they appeared in the show's trailer.Their lawsuit stated they only signed appearance release forms for the first season of the Netflix docu-series.Netflix now says they signed releases in 2019 that ""explicitly permit"" the footage use in later projects.The streamer and Royal Goode Productions, who are also included in the Baskins' legal claim, have called for it to be denied.Their case filing says Carole Baskin became a ""pop culture phenomenon"" as a result of Tiger King, adding she had ""no claim at all"" and her ""breach of contract claim is merely a red herring, lacking any merit"".Tiger King followed the rivalry between eccentric Oklahoma zoo owner Joe Exotic and animal rights activist Baskin.The show became a cultural phenomenon in March 2020, fuelled partly by the pandemic-enforced lockdowns.Carole Baskin, the owner and CEO of the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, has said she was unhappy with how she had been presented and described the series as ""a reality show dumpster fire"".The Baskins want Royal Goode Productions and Netflix to drop all footage of them from Tiger King 2 and are seeking to take the case in front of a jury.The lawsuit states: ""By utilising the film footage of the Baskins and Big Cat Rescue secured by Royal Goode Productions under the Appearance Releases in 'sizzle reels' and promotional trailers for the sequel entitled Tiger King 2, the defendants are in breach of the terms of the Appearance Releases.""The lawsuit also claims the first series gave a false impression of the work of Big Cat Rescue and unfairly accused the Baskins of animal abuse.""The Tiger King 1 series wrongly attempted to suggest that Big Cat Rescue abused its animals by keeping them in very small cages while not making clear that the animals actually reside in expansive enclosures,"" the legal papers state.""Perhaps most pernicious is the overarching implication in Tiger King 1 that Carole Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her first husband in 1997,"" the papers say. Carole Baskin has repeatedly denied that she had anything to do with the disappearance of her first husband Don Lewis.Netflix and Royal Goode Productions have called for the case to be denied as it ""strikes at the heart of the First Amendment"" of the US Constitution protecting free speech.An evidentiary hearing in the case is ""futile"" due to the ""insurmountable constitutional hurdle"", the streamer said.Last week a Florida judge had already denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that would block footage of the Baskins in the second season of Tiger King.The judge ruled that the Baskins ""are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order, which would be entered before Defendants have had an adequate opportunity to respond"".Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, And Madness told the story of Baskin's nemesis, the flamboyant big cat enthusiast Joe Exotic.Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was the owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, which he has now sold.In 2018, Exotic was arrested and accused of hiring two men to murder Baskin.The following year he was found guilty of multiple federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 22 years in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.An appeals court has since ruled Exotic should receive a shorter sentence after he said he'd been diagnosed with ""aggressive"" prostate cancer.The second season of Tiger King will stream on Netflix from 17 November.

184,Quantum Leap actor Dean Stockwell dies aged 85,"Dean Stockwell, the US actor known for playing Al in the sci-fi series Quantum Leap, has died aged 85.During a 70-year career, Stockwell won a Golden Globe award for the his best-known role and was also nominated for an Oscar for Married to the Mob.Aside from Quantum Leap, he also appeared in Air Force One, as well as the David Lynch films Blue Velvet and Dune.His representatives told the BBC he died peacefully at home on Sunday.Quantum Leap originally aired on NBC in the US for five seasons, from 1989 to 1993, and soon became popular with UK audiences too.It starred Scott Bakula as Dr Sam Beckett, a physicist who involuntarily leaps through space time using other people's bodies as vessels in order to correct historical mistakes. Stockwell co-starred as Admiral Al Calavicci, Dr Beckett's cigar-smoking and womanising best friend who appears to him in hologram form to offer guidance as the experiments unfold.""I have a particular fondness for Admiral Al Calavicci,"" Stockwell said in a 1994 interview. ""I guess people say that actors take a little bit of the part away with them, but if I really was as streetwise and cocky as Al, I'd probably have been a bigger star.""He won a Golden Globe award for the role in 1990 - for best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a TV series - and later received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.Last year, NBC announced it was considering a reboot of the show for its streaming service.Born into a family of entertainers in Los Angeles, Stockwell started his career as a child actor and made his first film appearance in 1945's Valley of Decision, before featuring alongside Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh.He then appeared in Broadway stage productions such as Compulsion, later reprising his role in the screen adaptation of the same name.In the mid-1960s though, Stockwell dropped out of showbusiness to join the Topanga Canyon hippie community, where members included the musician Neil Young.""I did some drugs and went to some love-ins,"" Stockwell later said of the experience. ""The experience of those days provided me with a huge, panoramic view of my existence that I didn't have before. I have no regrets.""He returned to Hollywood with roles in Paris, Texas, Dune and To Live and Die in L.A, before putting in a memorable cameo as the crooner Ben in the neo-noir mystery thriller Blue Velvet, where he performed a rendition of Roy Orbison's Dreams for Dennis Hopper and co.In 1988, he was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his performance as Mafia boss Tony ""the Tiger"" Russo in the comedy Married to the Mob. Stockwell called it ""the favourite part I've ever had in a film"". He said: ""I just felt that that part was just perfect for me and I had a way to approach it that I thought was just right and it turned out that way.""He also appeared in Francis Ford Coppella's The Rainmaker, as well as Robert Altman's The Player, and went on to have recurring TV roles in the Battlestar Galactica series and The Tony Danza Show.Stockwell was twice married - once to the actress Millie Perkins - and had two children.A statement from his publicity team read: ""Dean spent a lifetime yo-yoing back and forth between fame and anonymity. Because of that, when he had a job, he was grateful. He never took the business for granted. He was a rebel, wildly talented and always a breath of fresh air.

185,Travis Scott festival tragedy: Were warning signs missed at Astroworld?,"For almost 40 minutes after Houston police and firefighters responded to a ""mass casualty"" event at Travis Scott's packed Astroworld music festival on Friday, the superstar continued to perform.By the time he left the stage, it had become one of the deadliest concerts in US history. Eight people died and dozens more were injured. Fans were filmed chanting ""stop the show"" and pleading for staff to help. One even climbed onto a camera platform to point out the injured.Scott eventually ended his set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time. But questions remain about why it didn't finish sooner.""Nine thirty, right there. That's when a few people started going down,"" Houston police chief Troy Finner said at a press conference on Saturday. ""Our people stepped up and immediately went to the producers and told them, 'Hey, we got people going down.' This show ended at 10:10pm. I just wanted to acknowledge that.""Scott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched the event with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. He said in an Instagram video that he was not aware how bad things had become during his headline set this year.""Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need,"" he said. ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.""In footage from the concert, he can be seen interrupting his performance to ask for help for a fan who had passed out.However in another another video, he can be heard saying during another break: ""Who asked you to stop? Y'all know what y'all came to do - chase me, let's go.""The rapper is known for his wild shows, and has been in trouble for inciting dangerous behaviour in the past.In 2015, he was charged with disorderly conduct after encouraging fans in Chicago to ignore security and rush the stage.Two years later, he spotted a fan hanging from a venue's second-storey balcony and tried to persuade them to jump. At the same concert, a 27-year-old fan was paralysed after being pushed off a third-floor balcony.In 2019, hundreds of fans rushed the Astroworld barriers, with three people going to hospital with minor injuries. Police wrote on Twitter that the event was understaffed and that ""promoters did not plan sufficiently for the large crowds"", although the statement was later deleted.Fears about crowd safety had been raised before this year's event. A security plan obtained by the New York Times addressed several areas of concern.""Based on the site's layout and numerous past experiences, the potential for multiple alcohol/drug related incidents, possible evacuation needs, and the ever-present threat of a mass casualty situation are identified as key concerns,"" the document read.Before Scott took to the stage, local news teams filmed fans bursting through gates and bypassing security checkpoints.The city's police chief also visited the star in his dressing room to convey concerns about the energy in the crowd.In a statement, Chief Finner said the ""brief and respectful meeting"" allowed him to ""share my public safety concerns"" and ask the star ""to be mindful of his team's social media messaging on any unscheduled events."" So how could this tragedy happen?Investigators will look at a number of factors, says Simon Ancliffe, founder of Movement Strategies, which advises major UK events like Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds and the 2012 Olympics on crowd safety.""Have they controlled numbers? Are there barriers in place and were they well designed? Were security staff doing what they're supposed to do? Did they have good situational awareness? Did they have CCTV?""They did seem have to some kind of procedure to stop the show, but it seemed to stop and start - so was [the situation] about communications, was it about decision making?""When tragedies occur, he says, it's often not about one bad decision but an accumulation of smaller mistakes that ultimately lead to catastrophe. In this case, ""it sounds like a lot of things went wrong"".""It all comes down to planning,"" says Keith Still, a professor of crowd science at the University of Sussex.""You need to anticipate that this type of performer in that type of environment will induce this type of behaviour in the crowd - and you put crowd management and monitoring systems in place to make sure that you've got an early warning indicator.""Ancliffe says the teams on the ground are not necessarily to blame.""The security staff on the barriers can see what's immediately in front of them, but [only] a few people deep,"" he says, explaining that frontline staff need back-up in the form of CCTV or a more elevated view of the audience.In the UK, ""we have experienced crowd managers with a really good view of the crowd from a raised position, so you can see people's faces and look for the change in expression"", says Eric Stuart, chair of the UK Crowd Management Association. ""There's always going to be people screaming because they're having fun. The skill and the artform is looking at the faces and listening to the screams and saying, 'That's different. Things have changed.'""Many people in an audience often aren't aware of a life-threatening situation until it's too late.""When you're in a crowd, you can't see more than a couple of people in front of you, and you can't hear what's going on because of the music,"" says Ancliffe. ""So there's really bad information transfer within the crowd.""If people are pushing forwards, they can't see what's in front of them. And once you've fallen down, it's very difficult to get up again, unless people are helping you. And if people have bent over to help you, then they can be pushed over very easily as well.""So it's up to staff to identify problems and alert the performer, who can pause the show and calm the situation.In this case, it was the audience who notified security and were ""asking for things to change"", says Ancliffe.""So what was the situational awareness? What was the decision making? There may be other factors involved, but those will probably be the things where the disaster happened.""Some experts have also suggested Scott's decision to play on a separate stage with no other acts scheduled at the same time could have exacerbated the situation.That goes against a common practice in crowd management, known as ""spreading the field"", where organisers arrange several competing headliners or stagger stage times to control the flow of fans.But Scott's performance came 45 minutes after SZA had ended the day's final set on Astroworld's second stage. Fans who had been gathering near the barriers of his $5m ""Utopia Mountain"" arena since lunchtime were suddenly met with an influx of revellers, hyped up by a massive countdown clock heralding the star's arrival.""The crux of the problem likely happened as the clock got close to zero,"" one unnamed source told Variety magazine.One teenage fan said she got into difficulties almost immediately.""Once Travis Scott came on, I told myself this is the moment I've been preparing for, I just need to breathe,"" Diana Amira told NBC news. ""But... my ribcage was so squished that I couldn't expand my lungs to catch a breath.""Thankfully, crowd-related deaths at music events are relatively few and far between.""The first thing to say is that if you have an experienced crowd team on site, it won't reach that stage,"" Eric Stuart tells BBC Radio 5 Live.""If the worst comes to worst, there's a small group of people who have what we call the 'red card', and it is literally a message to the stage manager that we need to cut the music, we need to stop. ""And then we need to engage the artist for him or her to speak to the crowd. Ideally, we don't want a guy or girl in the high-vis jacket or the police coming on stage and talking to the crowd. The artist is the best person to do that.""That seems to have happened during Friday's concert. The question for investigators will be why the music continued after the initial call for help.In his video statement, Scott said he was ""working closely with everyone to get to the bottom of this"" and described himself as ""honestly just devastated"". Steve Adelman, vice president and lead counsel for the Event Safety Alliance, urged against apportioning blame at this stage. ""There is the instinct to rush to judgment before we know what actually happened,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine.Ancliffe hopes an inquiry will encourage promoters to ""tighten up their procedures or [concert] designs"".But Prof Still adds: ""If you look at any other safety-related industry - aviation, for example - if there's a near miss or a close call there's an investigation by experts, and new procedures are put into place to prevent that happening again.""Unfortunately, in the events industry, it comes down to litigation and it's generally settled out of court. I know, because I'm an expert witness in a number of international cases.""The court documents get sealed, the information never gets fed back into the industry and so there's no learning, there's no improvement.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

186,Actors to star in three plays at once for Sheffield Theatres' 50th birthday,"An ambitious new trilogy of plays will ask its actors to sprint between three theatres as they attempt to perform in all three at the same time.Rock/Paper/Scissors is three standalone but connected plays that will be staged simultaneously at the Sheffield Crucible, Studio and Lyceum theatres.The complex's artistic director Robert Hastie said he wanted ""a big challenge"" for its 50th birthday in 2022.""It's going to be a busy time for the actors,"" he said.Whereas an actor will normally wait in their dressing room between scenes, Rock/Paper/Scissors will require them to hot-foot it straight to one of the two neighbouring venues.The stars won't have to run too far, though. The Crucible and Studio are in the same building, while the Lyceum is next door.""The actors won't be going into backstage mode because an exit from one play is an entrance directly into another, with a short sprint between rooms,"" Hastie said.The cast has not yet been announced but Hastie and playwright Chris Bush are currently working out how to ensure the same actors can appear in three plays at the same time.""We've done a lot of spreadsheets and we've done a lot of sprinting between theatres, but until we actually get the actors in rehearsal, there's a lot that we've yet to discover,"" he said.The three parts of Rock/Paper/Scissors will follow three generations of a family exploring what to do with an old scissor manufacturing factory in the Steel City.Even the rehearsal process is a logistical headache. ""We're going to have to set up our rehearsal rooms so the time to get between them is exactly the same as the time to get between the stages,"" Hastie said.""If that timing isn't exactly right, then the whole thing won't work. Even if it means going up an extra staircase and back down another, we'll have to create a route [between rehearsal rooms] that's exactly the same distance as between the stages.""The precision of it will have to be immaculate. Chris is building in some space and some failsafe mechanisms within the scenes, but the whole thing will have to operate like a machine.""Rock/Paper/Scissors will be the centrepiece of Sheffield Theatres' 50th anniversary season, which will also include the return of Bush's collaboration with musician Richard Hawley, Standing at the Sky's Edge.Also following three Sheffield generations, the musical will then transfer to the National Theatre in London.Sheffield Theatres' three auditoria have a total capacity of 2,500 - the same as the National's three venues.""For the rest of the year, all three theatres will be doing very different things, making a really broad, diverse variety of work,"" Hastie said. ""It's just nice in the centre of our anniversary year to bring them together for the first and probably the only time in their history.""Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

187,Tiger King 2: Carole Baskin has 'no claim' to sue over footage - Netflix,"Netflix has said Carole Baskin has ""no claim"" in suing the company over the use of footage of her in Tiger King 2.Baskin and her husband Howard launched legal action against Netflix last week for breach of contract after they appeared in the show's trailer.Their lawsuit stated they only signed appearance release forms for the first season of the Netflix docu-series.Netflix now says they signed releases in 2019 that ""explicitly permit"" the footage use in later projects.The streamer and Royal Goode Productions, who are also included in the Baskins' legal claim, have called for it to be denied.Their case filing says Carole Baskin became a ""pop culture phenomenon"" as a result of Tiger King, adding she had ""no claim at all"" and her ""breach of contract claim is merely a red herring, lacking any merit"".Tiger King followed the rivalry between eccentric Oklahoma zoo owner Joe Exotic and animal rights activist Baskin.The show became a cultural phenomenon in March 2020, fuelled partly by the pandemic-enforced lockdowns.Carole Baskin, the owner and CEO of the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, has said she was unhappy with how she had been presented and described the series as ""a reality show dumpster fire"".The Baskins want Royal Goode Productions and Netflix to drop all footage of them from Tiger King 2 and are seeking to take the case in front of a jury.The lawsuit states: ""By utilising the film footage of the Baskins and Big Cat Rescue secured by Royal Goode Productions under the Appearance Releases in 'sizzle reels' and promotional trailers for the sequel entitled Tiger King 2, the defendants are in breach of the terms of the Appearance Releases.""The lawsuit also claims the first series gave a false impression of the work of Big Cat Rescue and unfairly accused the Baskins of animal abuse.""The Tiger King 1 series wrongly attempted to suggest that Big Cat Rescue abused its animals by keeping them in very small cages while not making clear that the animals actually reside in expansive enclosures,"" the legal papers state.""Perhaps most pernicious is the overarching implication in Tiger King 1 that Carole Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her first husband in 1997,"" the papers say. Carole Baskin has repeatedly denied that she had anything to do with the disappearance of her first husband Don Lewis.Netflix and Royal Goode Productions have called for the case to be denied as it ""strikes at the heart of the First Amendment"" of the US Constitution protecting free speech.An evidentiary hearing in the case is ""futile"" due to the ""insurmountable constitutional hurdle"", the streamer said.Last week a Florida judge had already denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that would block footage of the Baskins in the second season of Tiger King.The judge ruled that the Baskins ""are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order, which would be entered before Defendants have had an adequate opportunity to respond"".Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, And Madness told the story of Baskin's nemesis, the flamboyant big cat enthusiast Joe Exotic.Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was the owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, which he has now sold.In 2018, Exotic was arrested and accused of hiring two men to murder Baskin.The following year he was found guilty of multiple federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 22 years in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.An appeals court has since ruled Exotic should receive a shorter sentence after he said he'd been diagnosed with ""aggressive"" prostate cancer.The second season of Tiger King will stream on Netflix from 17 November.

Saber is yet to comment.The Kings Cross venue said it had ""backed and actively encouraged"" the band to report the matter to the police because ""the actions of these two individuals have far-reaching consequences for all of us"".It passed on its ""sincerest apologies"" to those directly affected by the incident.A spokeswoman added: ""Under no circumstance has or would Scala condone any such behaviour, we have always prided ourselves on the diversity of nightlife, concerts, clubs and customers that have come through our doors.""  Nu-metal act Wargasm had put on a live performance at the Pentonville Road venue as part of Facedown, which bills itself as ""London's biggest rock night"".The band's social media post states they were packing up their kit when security guards were ""verbally aggressive"" to their female tour manager, which led to Matlock ""having to step in"".The bouncers then ""dragged"" him into the toilets, ""slammed his head against the toilet seat"" and ""held his head in the toilet bowl"".Wargasm has criticised the security team's actions as a ""completely overzealous and unnecessary use of force"", adding that it no longer considers Scala to be a safe venue, ""especially for women"".The promoter of the club night, Facedown, which has said it is not responsible for security at the venue, said it did ""not appreciate people being manhandled in this way"".The Security Industry Authority, which regulates security licences, has confirmed it is investigating.A spokesman said: ""Violent behaviour is not acceptable.""The Met Police has been contacted for comment.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9E09/production/_121475404_wargasm3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-59222640,80,2021-11-09T13:15:20.000Z,entertainment

Things have changed.'""Many people in an audience often aren't aware of a life-threatening situation until it's too late.""When you're in a crowd, you can't see more than a couple of people in front of you, and you can't hear what's going on because of the music,"" says Ancliffe. ""So there's really bad information transfer within the crowd.""If people are pushing forwards, they can't see what's in front of them. And once you've fallen down, it's very difficult to get up again, unless people are helping you. And if people have bent over to help you, then they can be pushed over very easily as well.""So it's up to staff to identify problems and alert the performer, who can pause the show and calm the situation.In this case, it was the audience who notified security and were ""asking for things to change"", says Ancliffe.""So what was the situational awareness? What was the decision making? There may be other factors involved, but those will probably be the things where the disaster happened.""Some experts have also suggested Scott's decision to play on a separate stage with no other acts scheduled at the same time could have exacerbated the situation.That goes against a common practice in crowd management, known as ""spreading the field"", where organisers arrange several competing headliners or stagger stage times to control the flow of fans.But Scott's performance came 45 minutes after SZA had ended the day's final set on Astroworld's second stage. Fans who had been gathering near the barriers of his $5m ""Utopia Mountain"" arena since lunchtime were suddenly met with an influx of revellers, hyped up by a massive countdown clock heralding the star's arrival.""The crux of the problem likely happened as the clock got close to zero,"" one unnamed source told Variety magazine.One teenage fan said she got into difficulties almost immediately.""Once Travis Scott came on, I told myself this is the moment I've been preparing for, I just need to breathe,"" Diana Amira told NBC news. ""But... my ribcage was so squished that I couldn't expand my lungs to catch a breath.""Thankfully, crowd-related deaths at music events are relatively few and far between.""The first thing to say is that if you have an experienced crowd team on site, it won't reach that stage,"" Eric Stuart tells BBC Radio 5 Live.""If the worst comes to worst, there's a small group of people who have what we call the 'red card', and it is literally a message to the stage manager that we need to cut the music, we need to stop. ""And then we need to engage the artist for him or her to speak to the crowd. Ideally, we don't want a guy or girl in the high-vis jacket or the police coming on stage and talking to the crowd. The artist is the best person to do that.""That seems to have happened during Friday's concert. The question for investigators will be why the music continued after the initial call for help.In his video statement, Scott said he was ""working closely with everyone to get to the bottom of this"" and described himself as ""honestly just devastated"". Steve Adelman, vice president and lead counsel for the Event Safety Alliance, urged against apportioning blame at this stage. ""There is the instinct to rush to judgment before we know what actually happened,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine.Ancliffe hopes an inquiry will encourage promoters to ""tighten up their procedures or [concert] designs"".But Prof Still adds: ""If you look at any other safety-related industry - aviation, for example - if there's a near miss or a close call there's an investigation by experts, and new procedures are put into place to prevent that happening again.""Unfortunately, in the events industry, it comes down to litigation and it's generally settled out of court. I know, because I'm an expert witness in a number of international cases.""The court documents get sealed, the information never gets fed back into the industry and so there's no learning, there's no improvement.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

192,Actors to star in three plays at once for Sheffield Theatres' 50th birthday,"An ambitious new trilogy of plays will ask its actors to sprint between three theatres as they attempt to perform in all three at the same time.Rock/Paper/Scissors is three standalone but connected plays that will be staged simultaneously at the Sheffield Crucible, Studio and Lyceum theatres.The complex's artistic director Robert Hastie said he wanted ""a big challenge"" for its 50th birthday in 2022.""It's going to be a busy time for the actors,"" he said.Whereas an actor will normally wait in their dressing room between scenes, Rock/Paper/Scissors will require them to hot-foot it straight to one of the two neighbouring venues.The stars won't have to run too far, though. The Crucible and Studio are in the same building, while the Lyceum is next door.""The actors won't be going into backstage mode because an exit from one play is an entrance directly into another, with a short sprint between rooms,"" Hastie said.The cast has not yet been announced but Hastie and playwright Chris Bush are currently working out how to ensure the same actors can appear in three plays at the same time.""We've done a lot of spreadsheets and we've done a lot of sprinting between theatres, but until we actually get the actors in rehearsal, there's a lot that we've yet to discover,"" he said.The three parts of Rock/Paper/Scissors will follow three generations of a family exploring what to do with an old scissor manufacturing factory in the Steel City.Even the rehearsal process is a logistical headache. ""We're going to have to set up our rehearsal rooms so the time to get between them is exactly the same as the time to get between the stages,"" Hastie said.""If that timing isn't exactly right, then the whole thing won't work. Even if it means going up an extra staircase and back down another, we'll have to create a route [between rehearsal rooms] that's exactly the same distance as between the stages.""The precision of it will have to be immaculate. Chris is building in some space and some failsafe mechanisms within the scenes, but the whole thing will have to operate like a machine.""Rock/Paper/Scissors will be the centrepiece of Sheffield Theatres' 50th anniversary season, which will also include the return of Bush's collaboration with musician Richard Hawley, Standing at the Sky's Edge.Also following three Sheffield generations, the musical will then transfer to the National Theatre in London.Sheffield Theatres' three auditoria have a total capacity of 2,500 - the same as the National's three venues.""For the rest of the year, all three theatres will be doing very different things, making a really broad, diverse variety of work,"" Hastie said. ""It's just nice in the centre of our anniversary year to bring them together for the first and probably the only time in their history.""Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

193,Tiger King 2: Carole Baskin has 'no claim' to sue over footage - Netflix,"Netflix has said Carole Baskin has ""no claim"" in suing the company over the use of footage of her in Tiger King 2.Baskin and her husband Howard launched legal action against Netflix last week for breach of contract after they appeared in the show's trailer.Their lawsuit stated they only signed appearance release forms for the first season of the Netflix docu-series.Netflix now says they signed releases in 2019 that ""explicitly permit"" the footage use in later projects.The streamer and Royal Goode Productions, who are also included in the Baskins' legal claim, have called for it to be denied.Their case filing says Carole Baskin became a ""pop culture phenomenon"" as a result of Tiger King, adding she had ""no claim at all"" and her ""breach of contract claim is merely a red herring, lacking any merit"".Tiger King followed the rivalry between eccentric Oklahoma zoo owner Joe Exotic and animal rights activist Baskin.The show became a cultural phenomenon in March 2020, fuelled partly by the pandemic-enforced lockdowns.Carole Baskin, the owner and CEO of the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, has said she was unhappy with how she had been presented and described the series as ""a reality show dumpster fire"".The Baskins want Royal Goode Productions and Netflix to drop all footage of them from Tiger King 2 and are seeking to take the case in front of a jury.The lawsuit states: ""By utilising the film footage of the Baskins and Big Cat Rescue secured by Royal Goode Productions under the Appearance Releases in 'sizzle reels' and promotional trailers for the sequel entitled Tiger King 2, the defendants are in breach of the terms of the Appearance Releases.""The lawsuit also claims the first series gave a false impression of the work of Big Cat Rescue and unfairly accused the Baskins of animal abuse.""The Tiger King 1 series wrongly attempted to suggest that Big Cat Rescue abused its animals by keeping them in very small cages while not making clear that the animals actually reside in expansive enclosures,"" the legal papers state.""Perhaps most pernicious is the overarching implication in Tiger King 1 that Carole Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her first husband in 1997,"" the papers say. Carole Baskin has repeatedly denied that she had anything to do with the disappearance of her first husband Don Lewis.Netflix and Royal Goode Productions have called for the case to be denied as it ""strikes at the heart of the First Amendment"" of the US Constitution protecting free speech.An evidentiary hearing in the case is ""futile"" due to the ""insurmountable constitutional hurdle"", the streamer said.Last week a Florida judge had already denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that would block footage of the Baskins in the second season of Tiger King.The judge ruled that the Baskins ""are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order, which would be entered before Defendants have had an adequate opportunity to respond"".Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, And Madness told the story of Baskin's nemesis, the flamboyant big cat enthusiast Joe Exotic.Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was the owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, which he has now sold.In 2018, Exotic was arrested and accused of hiring two men to murder Baskin.The following year he was found guilty of multiple federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 22 years in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.An appeals court has since ruled Exotic should receive a shorter sentence after he said he'd been diagnosed with ""aggressive"" prostate cancer.The second season of Tiger King will stream on Netflix from 17 November.

194,Scala bans bouncers after Wargasm frontman assault claim,"Two bouncers have been banned from working at a music venue after an alleged attack on a band's frontman.Wargasm singer Sam Matlock said he was assaulted by three bouncers who pushed his head down a backstage toilet after a gig at Scala in central London.Scala said the two ""rogue"" security guards involved had been dismissed after a ""full-scale"" investigation.A photograph taken of Matlock after the gig on Friday night shows large red marks across his back and arms.Scala said it had checked CCTV footage and spoken to the directors of the company that employed the bouncers, Saber Security. Saber is yet to comment.The Kings Cross venue said it had ""backed and actively encouraged"" the band to report the matter to the police because ""the actions of these two individuals have far-reaching consequences for all of us"".It passed on its ""sincerest apologies"" to those directly affected by the incident.A spokeswoman added: ""Under no circumstance has or would Scala condone any such behaviour, we have always prided ourselves on the diversity of nightlife, concerts, clubs and customers that have come through our doors.""  Nu-metal act Wargasm had put on a live performance at the Pentonville Road venue as part of Facedown, which bills itself as ""London's biggest rock night"".The band's social media post states they were packing up their kit when security guards were ""verbally aggressive"" to their female tour manager, which led to Matlock ""having to step in"".The bouncers then ""dragged"" him into the toilets, ""slammed his head against the toilet seat"" and ""held his head in the toilet bowl"".Wargasm has criticised the security team's actions as a ""completely overzealous and unnecessary use of force"", adding that it no longer considers Scala to be a safe venue, ""especially for women"".The promoter of the club night, Facedown, which has said it is not responsible for security at the venue, said it did ""not appreciate people being manhandled in this way"".The Security Industry Authority, which regulates security licences, has confirmed it is investigating.A spokesman said: ""Violent behaviour is not acceptable.""The Met Police has been contacted for comment.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9E09/production/_121475404_wargasm3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-59222640,80,2021-11-09T13:15:20.000Z,entertainment

196,Why Tanzanian Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah is hardly known back home,"Zanzibar-born Abdulrazak Gurnah became the most talked-about writer in the world when he won this year's Nobel Prize for Literature, yet he is little known in Tanzania.The accolade for the 72-year-old author was hailed as ground-breaking for African writing, but in bookshops across the East Africa nation, Gurnah's novels are nowhere to be found. ""If you show his picture here, people will be seeing him for the first time,"" says Ally Saleh, a writer and poet from Zanzibar, the archipelago where Gurnah grew up and which was later incorporated into Tanzania.""A very small percentage of people in Tanzania will know about his work.""While Gurnah's books have been primarily marketed in the UK, where he has lived for the last five decades, his 10 novels analyse issues close to the heart of Zanzibaris. He explores the impact of colonialism on East African identity, and the experiences of refugees as they are forced to seek homes elsewhere.Gurnah himself left his home aged around 18 - fleeing the turmoil and violence that followed the 1964 revolution which overthrew Zanzibar's Arab minority ruling elite.Afterwards Zanzibar united with mainland Tanganyika to form Tanzania. The writer retains a strong connection to the island, which remains the backdrop for many of his stories.""It is important for Tanzanians to read Abdulrazak's work. He covers a lot of the realities of being Tanzanian both at home and overseas,"" says Mkuki Bgoya, director of Tanzanian publishers Mkuki na Nyota.""Often as East Africans, we see the world through other people's eyes. But with Gurnah, we can also see ourselves.""Since the announcement of the award in October, some Tanzanians has been left wondering how an author of Gurnah's stature could fall under the radar back home. It has also sparked debate about the country's declining reading culture.After the Zanzibar uprising, the new regime overhauled the education curriculum, placing less emphasis on literature. Currently none of Zanzibar's three universities teach literature as a degree. ""Following the revolution, the government closed several book clubs and libraries. Many excellent teachers left the country,"" says Ismail Jussa, a Zanzibari opposition politician.""Education was given a raw deal, standards dropped and with that, the reading culture became one of the many casualties."" On the mainland, there has similarly been a steady decline in the availability of literary works. Over the years, Tanzania's libraries, schools and bookshops have focused on textbooks and educational books, limiting access to fiction. While non-fiction and newspapers remain the more popular forms of reading, the rise of technology is now focusing the youth's attention on digital media. As a result, Tanzania has been left with a publishing industry struggling to sell literature. TPH Bookshop, the sister company of Mkuki na Nyota, in Tanzania's main city Dar es Salaam, has been one of the few bookshops in the country to stock Gurnah's work. ""We saw a huge gap in the publishing industry in Tanzania, which focuses solely on educational books. To address that we started producing and selling fiction, poetry and other literary works. Particularly works written by Tanzanians,"" says Mr Bgoya. ""Gurnah's novels took a long time to sell, so we didn't restock.""With a small customer base, this drives up the prices of books, making it unaffordable for many. ""The market is small and it cannot absorb a lot of books,"" he says.""They become very expensive, and when you are in a cash-strapped economy books become a luxury item."" Until now, Gurnah's work has also not been included on the country's literature syllabus at schools, despite the inclusion of other Swahili and African writers. ""He made his mark outside of Zanzibar and he has been away since 1967,"" says Mr Jussa.""So he was only known to a small circle of keen readers who follow literary works of Zanzibaris.""One reason for this is that Gurnah writes in English - not in Swahili, the language spoken by the majority of Tanzanians and which is the Nobel laureate's mother tongue.There have been fresh calls to translate his novels into Swahili. Dr Ida Hadjivayanis, a Swahili lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London, had already started work on this before Gurnah won the Nobel Prize.She is currently finishing the first Swahili translation of his book, Paradise, set to come out early next year. Paradise, published in 1994, is the story of a boy growing up in Tanzania in the early 20th Century - it was his breakthrough novel, nominated for several prestigious prizes, and Dr Hadjivayanis hopes her translation will bring new audiences to his work. ""Our history, reality and memories are all embedded in the work in such a beautiful way,"" says the academic, who is also from Zanzibar.""I think if his work could be read in East Africa it would have such an impact.""With the fame of Gurnah established in the literary world, many say now is the time to ensure his novels become a celebrated part of East African culture. Bookshops across the country, like TPH, have ordered new copies of Gurnah's novels after being inundated with requests. But there is still work to do to ensure he stays on the map.""Publishers should do their part in promoting our very own Nobel laureate and the government should do that too,"" says Dr Hadjivayanis. ""We can't change our reading culture overnight, so for him to be read the first steps would be to include Paradise and After Lives in the school curriculum. The rest will follow.""Priya Sippy is a freelance journalist based in London.More on African literature:",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/119BE/production/_121462127_gettyimages-671143118_976549.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59178826,80,2021-11-08T00:35:50.000Z,entertainment
197,How pop star Zara Larsson made a seven-figure sum on Roblox,"Pop star Zara Larsson says she's made a seven-figure sum by selling merchandise on the video game platform Roblox.The Swedish star, known for hits like Lush Life and Symphony, offers fans in-game items like hats, backpacks and sunglasses to dress up their avatars.With prices starting at less than £1, Larsson says it's ""freaking insane"" to have earned more than $1m (£740,000) since joining the platform in May.""My jaw dropped when I heard,"" the star tells the BBC. As parents around the world will know, Roblox is not so much a game as a gaming universe.Once logged in, users become blocky online characters and cultivate their own areas, setting challenges and creating obstacle courses for friends and strangers to complete. They pay a virtual currency called Robux to dress up their avatars or decorate stages, and often use the game as a place to hang out with friends - particularly during the pandemic.It is not without its critics. There have been concerns over children seeing sexually explicit and violent content inside the app, although the company has strict rules against adult material, and recently introduced an age verification system.The in-game marketplace can also be a source of tension for parents, with documented cases of children spending thousands of pounds on in-game items.Larsson first teamed up with Roblox to promote her new album, Poster Girl, when concerts were cancelled during the pandemic.She hosted a virtual ""dance party"" within the game in May, allowing fans to hang out, watch her perform, and take part in an online scavenger hunt.They could also buy outfits, hairstyles, dance moves and a customisable Zara Larsson avatar. Prices started at 60 Robux (approximately £0.67) rising to 400 Robux (£4.95) for the star's likeness.The merchandise was initially an afterthought, the singer says.""I didn't really think much about it. It wasn't really the motivation for the concert. I just wanted to connect with fans.""Needless to say, she's a convert now. In fact, Larsson says in-game concerts and virtual merchandise could be a lifeline for musicians at a time when CD sales have crumbled, touring is uncertain, and streaming royalties aren't compensating artists fairly.""We all know this,"" she says. ""Streaming services don't pay the most.""To make a seven-figure sum from YouTube or Spotify ""would take a long, long time and hundreds and millions of streams,"" she observes.But the attraction isn't solely financial. Larsson's Roblox show attracted more than 1.6 million users, who made more than four million visits to her pink, Swedish lake house-themed world. Many of those are fans who couldn't travel to a concert venue, or afford a concert ticket. Some even heard Larsson's music for the first time.""A lot of young people are commenting on my social media, 'Oh my God it's the Roblox girl!'"" she laughs. ""It's incredible. That's how they found out about me even though I've been doing this for 10 years.""With the COP26 climate summit taking place this week, she's also aware that virtual shows could greatly reduce her carbon footprint.""Imagine how many flights it would take to reach four million people? Or how many trucks it would take to bring a pink lake house with me everywhere?""And then having a couple of hundred people on a payroll, who also need accommodation and food and somewhere to sleep. ""Going online saves so much in carbon emissions.""The music industry expects that live streams and virtual concert experiences will continue to be a growth area, even after pandemic-related restrictions allow full-scale touring to resume.Fortnite and Minecraft have also conducted successful experiments with in-game gigs, featuring major artists like Travis Scott, Ariana Grande and Charli XCX.The technology can still be rudimental - US pop star Ava Max accidentally walked her character into a pit of lava and died while performing inside Roblox last year - but the experience is improving all the time, says Roblox's global head of music, Jonathan Vlassopulos.""We've got close to 50 million people on the platform every day - and once the penny drops that fans are hanging out for two or three hours a day in the metaverse, I think we'll see an explosion of artists joining,"" he says.""We're not limited by gravity and space, so we can build magical worlds and more high fidelity [experiences]"".But surely an in-game concert can never replicate the visceral feeling of playing to 500 fans, all crammed together in a sweaty club?""Of course from my perspective, it could be better, and maybe we'll get there one day,"" says Larsson. ""But until then it's a beautiful way of having an emotional connection. ""After my show, I wandered around the world and people were like, 'Let me take a selfie with you!'""I didn't get it at first - but then they just put their avatar really close to mine, and took a screenshot and that's the selfie. ""And yeah, that could be hard for my generation to understand - but for people who live their lives online and are being social online, it means as much to them as meeting me on the street.""It's really made me think about what touring could look like in the future.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

198,Dug Dug: A film inspired by India's motorcycle god,"A new film, which is based on a bizarre story of a temple dedicated to a motorcycle deity, is creating a buzz in the international festival circuit, writes Faizal Khan. Modestly titled, Dug Dug, echoing the thumping sound of a Royal Enfield motorcycle first made in the English town of Redditch, Worcestershire, more than a century ago, the film has a fairy tale plot. An inebriated man driving a motorcycle on a highway is run over by a truck. Next morning, his vehicle disappears from police custody and mysteriously surfaces on the same spot where he had died. Hauled back to the police station, the motorcycle keeps returning to the roadside scene of the accident. A combination of village intrigue and superstition soon lifts the dead man into a saint and his motorcycle a deity in the desert state of Rajasthan. The Hindi language film is a scorching satire on the quirky rituals and commercialisation of religion. Narrated with simplicity, the film explores the drama and mystique that makes droves of unsuspecting people want to cling to their bizarre beliefs.""If you believe in something wholeheartedly, it works for you,"" said Ritwik Pareek, the director of Dug Dug, who was born in Jaipur, Rajasthan's capital.The 107-minute feature film, which had its premiere at the 46th Toronto International Film Festival last month, is inspired by a temple in Pali, about 75km (46 miles) from Jodhpur, a favourite destination with foreign tourists in the state.The deity of the roadside temple is an old Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle kept on a pedestal. The motorcycle belonged to local resident Om Singh Rathore who died in an accident on the highway connecting Jodhpur to Jaipur city more than three decades ago. The temple, popularly known as the ""Bullet Baba"" (Baba in Hindi means saint) temple, is a favourite spot for truck drivers on long hauls who stop at Pali to offer prayers to keep them safe on the country's tricky highways.  India tops the number of road-accident deaths in the world accounting for 11% of all such  fatalities around the world, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways that recorded 151,113 accident deaths in 2019 for which the latest data is available.""In India we have so many temples, one is more bizarre than the other,"" said Pareek, who quit his job as an art director in advertising in Mumbai six years ago to become a full-time filmmaker. And instead of staying in Mumbai, the seat of Bollywood, he returned home to Jaipur.One day he was reading The God Delusion, a 2006 book by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins questioning religious beliefs, when Pareek remembered the motorcycle deity in Jodhpur. ""The idea for Dug Dug was born there,"" he said. Pareek soon headed for the ""Bullet Baba' temple and several more across Rajasthan in the next five months for research.""I visited the temple in Pali as a kid. My family is very religious and my grandmother used to take me with her whenever she visited temples. She was very strict about rituals,"" said the filmmaker, who deputed his father to Jodhpur to talk to Rathore's family about making a movie. The family had two conditions -  don't use Rathore's real name and no mention of his caste.After he finished writing the script, Pareek auditioned over a hundred people, most of them non-professional actors from villages around Ramgarh, about 40km from Jaipur where the film is shot. A local man selected for playing Thakur Lal, the film's character based on Rathore, left the set saying he revered Rathore too much to play him. An old Luna, an Indian moped modelled on the Italian Piaggio vélo bike, replaced Rathore's Bullet motorcycle in the film.""This is our version of the Jodhpur temple story,"" said Prerna Ritwik, the director's sister and the film's producer about their first feature film. ""In India, almost everyone has a story from their childhood that involves a miracle,"" she added. ""It never pokes fun at anyone, instead shows you the power of belief,"" said Rohan Rajadhyaksha, a member of the Indian musical group Salvage Audio Collective, which composed the music for the film.The film and its makers are now waiting for another run on the international festival circuit.

199,Voyage: 'Vintage Abba' or 'bafflingly retrograde' - comeback album splits opinion,"Forty years after their last studio album, Abba have made one of the most anticipated comebacks in music with the release of their new record, Voyage.The 10-track album has divided opinion among critics, however.""It's vintage Abba, on par with their classic 1970s run,"" declared Rolling Stone in a four-star review.But The Guardian's two-star write-up warned that Voyage is a ""disappointment"" that languishes in ""often bafflingly retrograde settings"".The album comes two months after the Swedish pop legends released the first two new songs, I Still Have Faith In You and Don't Shut Me Down.The Guardian's Jude Rogers said ""the glamour promised by this album's two terrific singles goes horribly unfulfilled"".""Rather than reflecting poignantly on the past, much of the rest of Voyage feels terminally stuck there.""Of the album tracks, When You Danced With Me provokes ""mild nausea"" while a Christmas song called Little Things, which is third on the track list, is a ""big crime against sense, sentimentality and sequencing"", she said.""If only they had stopped at those two knowing songs, leaving the rest to our dazzling imaginations.""Even Rolling Stone filed Little Things under ""stomach-churning filler"".""But otherwise,"" the magazine's critic Rob Sheffield wrote, ""Voyage reflects how far these four have travelled, musically and emotionally.""There's no embarrassing attempt to get up to date with the bops the kids are into these days, a compliment to their integrity.""Voyage ""piles on the tragic drama"", he wrote. ""It's a whole album of The Winner Takes It All, without any Mamma Mia or Take a Chance On Me.""He concluded: ""It's a surprise to have these Swedes back in the game. But it's a bigger, sweeter surprise that they returned so full of musical vitality.""The Independent's Helen Brown gave Voyage five stars and agreed that it was ""a triumphant album awash with Abba's gung-ho uncoolness"" that ""delivers all the classic Abba flavours"".""Abba haven't tried to update the gloriously gaudy vintage tinsel of their 80s office party sound,"" she said. ""[Bjorn] Ulvaeus and [Benny] Andersson have always been canny businessmen and they know their appeal has never been about being 'on trend'.""The Times' critic Ed Potton described Voyage as ""a reassuringly familiar blend of clear-eyed sentiment, outrageous musicality and utter indifference to fashion"".He wrote: ""Like much of Abba's back catalogue, these songs can sound naff on first listen, yet you're pulled in by Benny Andersson's melodic oomph and Bjorn Ulvaeus's eccentric lyrical insights.""Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad share the lead vocals, and their voices, though a touch lower, remain pristine and moving.""Despite the piano on Just A Notion being ""dangerously reminiscent of Shakin' Stevens"", Potton alluded to the lyrics of I Still Have Faith In You when he concluded: ""Do they have it in them? On the strength of these 10 songs, it's a resounding yes.""The i newspaper's Kate Solomon referred to the same lyric, but came up with a different answer.""Do they have it in them? Sadly, the answer on Voyage is no,"" she wrote.It is a ""strange, confused record"", she explained.""It feels like we've been promised paradigm-shifting new material and ended up with a load of B-sides and rarities...""There's a sort of Sound of Music feel to the whole endeavour; a slightly daggy, overly sentimental attempt at recapturing something that had already been lost.""The Telegraph's Neil McCormick said Faltskog and Lyngstad ""can still hold a tune"", while Andersson and Ulvaeus ""have not lost their ability to craft a flowing melody adorned with glittering hooks"".""Voyage is a gentle OAP cruise around the backwaters of Abba's reputation,"" he wrote.The New Statesman's Kate Mossman said she was ""repeatedly struck by the bizarre tone of late-period Abba's domestic psychodramas"".""Abba do a great line in mature romance, though - a kind of knowing, twinkly-eyed boomer romance you don't see anywhere else apart from on ads for life insurance.""Andersson told BBC News that ""we don't need to prove anything here"", adding: ""I don't think we're taking a risk because if people think that we were better 40 years ago, fine.""He said he thinks Voyage will be the quartet's swansong. ""I've said that's it,"" he told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""I don't want to do another Abba album.""But I'm not alone in this. There are four of us. If they twist my arm, I might change my mind.""Ulvaeus added: ""I never say never, but I agree with Benny. I think that was our goodbye.""The band will, however, continue in the form of animated digital avatars dubbed Abbatars, which will ""perform"" at virtual concerts in a specially-constructed arena in London from next May.On Thursday, they released a trailer giving an idea of how the shows will look.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1274F/production/_120399557_5830ee6a-d137-4ab3-91a6-1a139ccba4c8.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59175090,80,2021-11-05T10:52:53.000Z,entertainment
200,Give Us A Clue to Extras: The life of Lionel Blair,"Lionel Blair will be remembered as a variety entertainer of the old school, whose mischievous wit, flamboyance and ever-twinkling eye kept him popular whatever the decade. His self-taught talent as a dancer and choreographer made him famous, taking him from child performer to Sammy Davis Jr's dance-off competitor in front of the Queen Mother. But in a career spanning more than 70 years, Blair also did a lot of acting, especially in the early years. And he worked with, or counted as friends, myriad showbusiness legends including Bob Hope, The Beatles and Liza Minnelli. As the decades advanced, Blair popped up as a (non-dancing) guest on multiple popular TV programmes - quiz show Blankety Blank to name but one. And most people knew him as an ever-present celebrity who danced a bit, as opposed to a celebrity dancer.  It was his role as a team captain on the 1980s Give Us A Clue game show which became his calling card, even though he later ventured into reality TV, including an infamous PVC-clad turn in Celebrity Big Brother.And though he also became a would-be retiree of The Real Marigold Hotel, there was never any thought of disappearing into anonymity for Blair. The chat show invites kept coming, as did the tours, played up and down the UK.""People still say, almost in a derogatory way, 'Oh, you're a dancer'. Or, 'You're so showbiz',"" he said in 2018. ""Well what's wrong with that? I am. I love it. I'm thrilled to have been part of showbiz for so many years.""Henry Lionel Blair Ogus, to give him his original full name, got an early start to life in the spotlight. He was born in Montreal in 1928, the son of a Jewish barber who had emigrated from Russia to Canada. Blair's father moved the family to London and, when World War Two broke out, Henry Lionel and his older sister Joyce began entertaining people in air raid shelters with their improvised dance routines.  ""From an early age Joyce and I were taken to the pictures - it was always Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or Shirley Temple,"" Blair once recounted, explaining where his inspiration had come from. ""We used to go home and try to copy them. That's how we learned to tap dance.""  At 13, Blair was devastated by the death of his father. ""It changed everything... I don't think I've ever experienced loss like it,"" he said.With no family breadwinner, he began working as an actor. He then teamed up again with Joyce in musical productions before flying solo and making his acting debut aged 14 in Watch on the Rhine.  The Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford followed. And as Blair's acting career progressed, he performed Stoppard and Ayckbourn. But it was as a dancer that he was to excel. In the 1960s, he came to public attention after forming the troupe Lionel Blair and His Dancers, who became regulars on TV variety shows.A career defining moment came in 1961 when Blair stepped onto the stage of London's Prince of Wales Theatre for the Royal Variety Command Performance - accompanied by none other than Sammy Davis Jr.They went on to perform a bizarre comedy sketch which saw ""Savile Row shop assistant"" Blair teach ""gauche American"" Davis how to be posh. As the act progressed, the dancing became competitive, as the duo bid to out-dance each other. Neither did and Davis Jr and Blair became lifelong friends. ""It was the highlight of my career... that was one of the most thrilling things, ever. He was just so kind to me. He gave me a silver dollar. I carry it with me all the time,"" Blair later recalled. An appearance as a choreographer in the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night in 1964 enhanced his reputation and he choreographed other films such as The Magic Christian in 1969. In 1967, Blair married his wife Susan. The couple went on to have three children and three grandchildren. Blair later revealed on ITV's Loose Women how he had stolen his future wife from his friend after a ""Cupid's arrow"" moment at a dinner party.""I walked in the room and honestly, I took one look at her and it hit me. I thought, 'That's the girl I am going to marry'... six weeks later we were married,"" Blair told the audience.""The secret of a successful marriage is memories... that's why my dad insisted that we went everywhere together, so we could talk about things. I'm so lucky to have a wife who is a nest builder. Her nest is the most important thing in the world to her,"" he also told the Guardian. ""We've got a very, very normal family, and for me everything comes back to family. If they're sad, I'm sad. I want them to be happy all the time."" On TV shows in the 1970s, Blair was often roped in to choreograph and/or perform. ""Everybody said: 'Give us a twirl, Lionel'. If that's what they want, that's what they're going to get,"" he later joked about his hoofer's reputation.He built on his growing status as a household name with frequent spots on primetime family programmes such as The Tommy Cooper Hour and the Jimmy Tarbuck Show.Towards the end of the decade, Blair had established his celebrity to such an extent that he became a judge on ITV's X-Factor forerunner New Faces in 1976.But it was in the 1980s that Blair earned a cosier affection as a star of TV games shows Name That Tune and the charades hit, Give Us A Clue. The women's team captain was Una Stubbs and the series featured a galaxy of famous team players. ""We did well over 1,000 shows between 1979 and 1982,"" Blair later proudly recalled.  In the mid-90s, Blair became the butt of lewd gay Give Us A Clue jokes on Radio 4's I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. They went on for nearly 15 years, made originally by host Humphrey Lyttelton and continued by his successor Jack Dee. The audience loved it. Blair himself was less amused. ""It was merciless and just plain mean. I didn't mind for myself but my wife and family really hated it and became very upset,"" he told the Mirror. ""I don't understand why they had to be gay gags either. Yes, I'm very over-the-top and flamboyant but I always have been. I'm theatrical, darling!""I could have sued, I suppose, but that would have been breaking the comedians' code - and you simply don't do that.""Established as a ""good get"" for a many a TV show, Blair continued to turn up regularly on a range of programmes - frequently as himself. They included Channel Five's The Farm, sending himself up in the final episode of Ricky Gervais' Extras in 2007, a one-off spot in Emmerdale and an outrageous spell in the Celebrity Big Brother house.  In 2007, Blair was diagnosed with and recovered from prostate cancer. There were also some bizarre non-career related episodes in his colourful life, including the kidnap of his pet dog Florence in 2006, the same year he and the comedian Alan Carr saved a man who was about to fall from Blackpool pier. Late into his life, Blair continued to appear in pantomimes and gigs on game and chat shows. He toured the UK in both group and solo productions, including Tap & Chat With Lionel Blair, a convivial trawl through the variety performer's life and times. His decision to check into The Real Marigold Hotel in India was driven by his dancer's competitiveness. ""I signed up... because of the show that I saw before - I thought if Wayne Sleep can do it, I can do it!,"" he said. If anything, the show proved that, for Blair, life in all its infinite variety is for living - no matter your age. There is, he said, ""something exciting around every corner"". ""I've been in this business since I was 13 and it's given me a wonderful life.""
