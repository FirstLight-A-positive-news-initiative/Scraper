8,"Communists have now left the Czech parliament, more than three decades after the Velvet Revolution","When the Czech Republic's 200 newly-elected deputies gathered for the inaugural session of its new parliament on Monday, there wasn't a single Communist party member there -- for the first time in 76 years.  The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), the direct successor of the totalitarian Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, has dropped out of the lower house of the Czech parliament after failing to gain any seats in last month's election. The party lost its last seat in the upper house, the Senate, in 2018.The final departure of the Communists from the top levels of Czech politics marks a hugely symbolic moment for many survivors of the totalitarian regime, especially after the outgoing government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis breached a long-standing taboo and relied on the votes of the Communists in the parliament to secure a majority in 2018, giving them indirect access to power. While the party has attempted to re-brand itself as a modern and democratic leftist group in recent years, it never fully removed its association with the acts of its totalitarian predecessor. Marek Benda -- of the Civic Democratic Party and the country's longest serving Member of Parliament -- said he never expected the Communists to stay in parliament for so long after the revolution. ""We thought that they would still have some voters, but that these would gradually disappear ... but they were doing quite well for much longer,"" Benda said.  Jan Rovny, an associate professor at Sciences Po in Paris, said the decline of the party is down mostly to the ""demographic replacement of its elder voters, nostalgic for communist regime certainties."" But, writing in a policy blog, Rovny said the rise of populist parties like Babis' ANO and the far-right SPD have also contributed to the Communists' downfall.""From its heyday at the helm of the authoritarian regime, the KSCM has been reduced to a radical left protest party in the post-1989 democracy,"" he wrote. ""The recent rise of cultural themes, centering on fears of migration advanced by the SPD and increasingly by ANO, has changed the substance of protest politics. The party's core districts in the post-industrial northern regions have shifted allegiance.""KSCM's leadership resigned following the party's election defeat. Jiri Dolejs, a member of the KSCM board, told CNN that the party's demise reflects a wider downfall of the left in Europe, pointing to other groups that have suffered losses, such as Germany's Die Linke.""The left has been competing with populists, migration and health crises have pushed away the traditional competition between the left and the right,"" he said. Vojtech Filip, the outgoing former KSCM leader, told Halo Noviny, a Czech leftist newspaper closely tied to the party: ""It is a great disappointment. The [election] debacle of the KSCM means that for the first time in modern history, the Communist Party will not be part of parliamentary democracy in the Czech Republic. The communists now face the task of doing everything in their power to regain prominence,"" The group's newly-installed leader, Katerina Konecna, said her priority would be working to gain more support among younger people. According to the party's official newspaper, the average age of KSCM members is now 75. 'Very much stuck in the old ways'Benda was one of the student leaders of the 1989 revolution and entered parliament shortly after the fall of the communist regime. ""When I first entered the parliament, there were 70 of us new deputies and 130 of the old guys,"" he told CNN.  ""It was quite extreme, some of the old members were the real, old-school comrades. Of course the worst people were thrown out, but those that remained were still very much stuck in the old ways.""He said that as a 21-year-old, he was addressed in an informal way by many of the old-school Communists, something he said he ""just couldn't get used to.""Benda said he sees the final exit of KSCM from the Czech parliament as a ""huge success."" ""Especially because it happened in a democratic way, they fizzled out on their own,"" he added. The MP said there was no appetite for the party to be banned after the revolution: ""The atmosphere was not one of revenge and the West was also not supportive of the idea of making the party illegal.""While it took 32 years for KSCM to drop out of parliament, the group's final exit is more symbolic coming in 2021, a century after the original Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was formed.

10,"Israel doubles down against US, saying there is no room in Jerusalem for an American Consulate for Palestinians","Sitting next to the Israeli Foreign Minister in Washington this October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was clear: The Americans want to re-open their consulate in Jerusalem to serve Palestinians. ""We'll be moving forward with the process of opening a consulate as part of deepening of those ties with the Palestinians,"" Blinken said at the State Department. Less than a month later, Israel's political leadership was also clear: it has no plans to approve such a consulate (the host country must approve any new foreign consulate). Asked by CNN at a press conference Saturday evening about US intentions, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said his government had presented its opinion to the Americans ""clearly and openly.""  ""There is no room for another American consulate in Jerusalem. We always present our position quietly without drama and we expect it to be understood. Jerusalem is the capital of one state and that's the state of Israel,"" Bennett said, standing alongside Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. ""I'm sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""  Lapid, who sat next to Blinken as he made those comments in Washington last month, echoed Bennett's sentiments, adding that if the Americans want to open a consulate for Palestinians in Ramallah, they would be welcome to do so.    ""As for the (US) consulate, as we both said it is not about politics and political stability. It is the State of Israel refusing in principle that a consulate be opened in Jerusalem,"" Lapid said. Former President Donald Trump folded the consulate in 2019, merging it into the new American embassy in Jerusalem after moving it from Tel Aviv when the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. For many Palestinians, an American consulate in Jerusalem is a precursor to what they hope will one day be an American Embassy in East Jerusalem, capital of a potential future state of Palestine. The Americans have been seen as largely holding off from major confrontations with Israel over issues like the consulate or the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as a way to help shore up the stability of the coalition government. Stitched together from a diverse group of eight parties representing a broad spectrum of ideologies, the government came to power in June agreeing on few subjects except a desire to oust former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after 12 years in power. Passing a new state budget at the end of last week -- which had not been accomplished since 2018 leading to Israel's record four elections in two years -- puts the government on much more stable ground (because failure to do so by November 14 would have triggered new elections). Now some world partners, including European diplomats like Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, have made it clear that with the new government now looking more secure, it is time to start pushing Israel harder on issues related to the Palestinians.  ""I think that both the EU and the US quite frankly have been cautious in terms of any criticism of this new Israeli government because it is a fragile government,"" Coveney told CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday. But with the budget passed, and Israel's government looking set, ""both Washington as well as the European Union needs to now focus on their relationship with this new Israeli government, and make it very clear to them that if we are serious about delivering a peace process together, well, then expanding settlements not only is illegal, but it is also unacceptable to the international community,"" he added. Hussein Al Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority's head of Civil Affairs, said in a tweet on Sunday that Bennett's statements about the consulate in Jerusalem represent a ""challenge from the Israeli government to the #Biden administration,"" seeing as it had ""already announced repeatedly its decision to open the US Consulate in East Jerusalem!!!""  While the new Israeli government's mantra in its relations with the United States has been ""no drama,"" especially when it comes to a possible return to the Iran nuclear deal, the Biden administration has openly criticized the Israeli government recently over issues related to the Palestinians. A recent announcement by Israel to green light thousands of new Israeli housing units in the West Bank, was criticized by the State Department, whose spokesperson Ned Price called it ""completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm."" Israel's move to label six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organizations, accusing them of working with the designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also drew some sharp words from the Europeans and Americans. ""We believe respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a strong civil society are critically important for responsible and responsive governance,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at the time. But when asked on Saturday if his government was headed toward a confrontation and increased tensions with the Americans, now that the budget had passed, Bennett simply said, ""No."" ""There is so much more we agree upon with American friends that we disagree upon,"" the Prime Minister said, adding "" I am sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.""

18,'Go be happy': Thousands of baby river turtles released in Peruvian jungle,"Some 3,000 baby river turtles native to the Amazon rainforest were released into a Peruvian river on Thursday after hatching from eggs kept on artificial beaches as part of a conservation effort.The river turtles are considered ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and have for many years been killed for human consumption, or kept as pets.""The importance lies in the conservation of the species in the area because it has already been threatened for a long time,"" said Sabrina Pipa, a biologist who works on the protection of freshwater turtles.""The objective is the repopulation of the species.""The turtles carry the scientific name Podocnemis unifilis, but Peruvians call them taricayas. They are yellow-spotted and the baby ones measure just a couple of inches.Peru has the second largest share of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil.Scientists agree that conserving the Amazon rainforest is vital to avoid catastrophic climate change because of its ability to absorb greenhouse gases.But over the past two decades, more than 19,700 square kilometers (7,600 square miles) of the Peruvian Amazon have been destroyed.Pipa said the taricaya project began in 2019 and had protected about 6,000 river turtles, in addition to those conserved this year.People gathered in the city of Iquitos to see the baby turtles make their way down a river beach towards the water.""Go!

19,"Marília Mendonça, chart-topping Brazilian musician, dies in plane crash","Brazilian country music star Marília Mendonça died in a plane crash on Friday in a rural region of the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, according to her public relations firm.She was en route to a concert at the time of the crash, which killed four other people in addition to the singer. Mendonça, 26, is survived by her 1-year-old son, according to CNN Brasil.The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but in a statement on Friday, the Minas Gerais Electric Company (CEMIG) said Mendonça's plane had hit a cable on an electric tower belonging to the power firm.Minas Gerais police chief Ivan Lopes Sales said at a news conference Friday that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash but added the dispersed debris field suggested the aircraft had ""hit something before the plane fell.""News of the death of the charismatic Latin Grammy winner, known as ""the Boss"" to her millions of fans, shocked the country Friday. Prominent Brazilians, including football star Neymar, came forward in the wake of the news to share their grief.Mendonça quickly rose to fame in the popular sertanejo country music genre and made her mark by singing about women's empowerment in an environment traditionally dominated by male musicians. She was the most-listened to artist in Brazil on Spotify in 2019 and 2020, according to her PR firm, and had more than 38 million followers on Instagram.Neymar, a close friend of the singer, wrote on Twitter: ""I refuse to believe it, I refuse.""Ronaldo Caiado, governor of Mendonça's home state of Goiás, said her family had confirmed a funeral for the singer would begin around 8 a.m. local time Saturday in an arena in the state capital, Goiânia.

20,Campaigners make last effort to save man with intellectual disabilities from execution in Singapore,"Campaigners are making a last ditch effort to save a man with intellectual disabilities from execution in Singapore, in a case that has been described a ""sickening"" and a ""systemic failure,"" and put the city-state's zero-tolerance drug laws back under scrutiny. Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a 33-year-old Malaysian man, was arrested in 2009 for bringing 42.7 grams (1.5 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. He is due to be executed by hanging on Wednesday. The High Court dismissed a last minute constitutional challenge from his lawyer on Monday but granted a stay of execution so the decision could be appealed, lawyer M. Ravi posted on Facebook -- a small glimmer of hope for Dharmalingam's supporters.During the appeal hearing on Tuesday, the court ordered another stay of execution after announcing Dharmalingam tested positive for Covid-19, according to Ravi. The stay of execution will remain in place until the new appeal is heard.Dharmalingam's older sister, Sarmila Dharmalingham, said in a statement the family has been ""struggling"" but she is ""relieved"" to hear the execution had been stayed. ""But I'm only a little bit happy, because I know they haven't actually stopped the execution, only given it a temporary stay,"" she said. ""We have been told by the prison that we will not be allowed to visit him anymore, and that we will only be allowed phone calls with him.""Dharmalingam's lawyers and rights groups fighting to save him say Singapore is violating international law by executing a person with a mental impairment. They have exhausted all other legal appeals and a petition to the President for clemency was unsuccessful.Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement Dharmalingam ""was accorded full due process under the law, and was represented by legal counsel throughout the process.""However, his lawyers argue that Dharmalingam should not have been sentenced to death under Singaporean law because he was incapable of understanding his actions. A psychologist assessed his IQ to be 69, which is internationally recognized as an intellectual disability. At his trial, the defense also argued he had severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline intellectual functioning, and severe alcohol use disorder.Dharmalingam has spent a decade on death row and during that time his condition has further deteriorated, his lawyers said. ""He has not a very good sense of what is happening around him,"" said N. Surendran, a Malaysian lawyer who is representing Dharmalingam's family, and adviser to Malaysian NGO Lawyers for Liberty. ""He is disoriented. He's got no real clue of what is going to happen to him.""Surendran said executing Dharmalingam ""would be tantamount to executing a child.""Singapore has some of the strictest drug laws in the world. Trafficking a certain amount of drugs -- for example, 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of heroin -- results in a mandatory death sentence under the Misuse of Drugs Act. It was only recently -- and after Dharmalingam's case began -- the law was amended to allow for a convicted person to escape the death penalty in certain circumstances. Dharmalingam was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by Singapore's High Court in 2010. His first appeal was dismissed a year later. Another appeal after Singapore amended its drug law was again rejected in 2018.""The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court's decision and said that it was satisfied that Nagaenthran clearly understood the nature of his acts,"" the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement. The court argued Dharmalingam transported drugs ""in order to pay off his debts"" and he knew it was unlawful so he ""attempted to conceal the bundle by strapping it to his left thigh."" It also said Dharmalingam was ""continuously altering his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed.""""This was 'the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question.' Nagaenthran considered the risks, balanced it against the reward he had hoped he would get, and decided to take the risk,"" the ministry said in its statement, quoting the court's decision. Public pressureDharmalingam's case has sparked international condemnation -- even British Virgin boss Richard Branson has appealed for clemency.Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has written to his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsein Loong asking for leniency, Malaysian state media Bernama reported. More than 62,000 people have signed a petition urging Singapore's President Halimah Yacob to issue a pardon. Last week, dozens of activists protested outside Parliament in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (ADPAN) and other rights groups have also called on the Singapore government to halt the execution. ""Executing a man with a disability, who was convicted after an investigation and trial that provided no disability-specific accommodations, violates international law and won't deter crime,"" Emina Ćerimović, senior disability rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""Singapore should commute Nagaenthran Dharmalingam's sentence and amend its laws to ensure that no one is subjected to the death penalty, certainly not people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.""Surendran, the lawyer, said the execution order was ""sickening beyond belief.""He criticized the court for ordering the appeal hearings on Tuesday, arguing it gave little time prepare submissions overnight. ""These unreasonable court directions and unholy rush to have both hearings heard in less than 24 hours amounts to a blatant denial of due process to Nagaenthran contrary to Article 9 of the Singapore Constitution. No criminal justice system in any country which upholds the rule of law, rushes through criminal appeals in this manner; and all the more so in a death penalty case,"" he said. Family 'shocked'Dharmalingam's family, who live in Ipoh, northwestern Malaysia, were notified of his impending execution only on October 26. His lawyer in Singapore, M. Ravi posted the letter to Facebook, calling the order ""state sanctioned murder.""The letter stipulated only five members of Dharmalingam's family would be allowed to enter Singapore and would need to contend with a list of Covid regulations.Four family members -- his mother, brother, sister and a cousin -- managed to travel to Singapore and meet with Dharmalingam in Changi prison but were ""shocked"" at his condition, Surendran said. ""They see a completely different person, they're not able to get through to him,"" he said. Anti-death penalty activist Kirsten Han, launched a crowdfunding campaign that raised more than $19,000 Singapore dollars to pay for the family's flights and hotels.""This is not something that the family could have afforded themselves,"" she said. She said the execution order, made worse because it was issued shortly after the important Hindu festival Deepavali, which Dharmalingam's family celebrates, is ""very emblematic of how cold and clinical the entire death penalty regime is."" ""The Singapore government has insisted for a very long time that (the law) protects Singapore. But drug policy experts say there's no proof that this sort of punitive capital punishment regime deters drug trafficking,"" Han said.

21,Pakistan government and local Taliban agree to 'complete ceasefire' ,"The Pakistani government and the armed militant group the Pakistani Taliban have agreed to a one-month ceasefire while negotiations get underway to end years of bloodshed. Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry announced Monday a ""complete ceasefire"" was agreed with the group, known as the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP is a banned Islamist group that is responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in Pakistan's history, including an assault on an army-run school in 2014 that killed 132 children, as well as the 2012 attempt to kill schoolgirl Malala Yousufzai, who became a Nobel laureate and education rights activist. In a statement, Chaudhry said talks with the TTP are ""underway"" and a truce will be extended as the talks progress. He said negotiations are in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan.Talks will focus on ""state sovereignty, national security, peace in conflict zones along with social and economic stability,"" Chaudhry said.""It is heartening that there will be peace in these conflict ridden areas,"" he said. TPP spokesperson Muhammad Khurasani said both sides would observe a one-month ceasefire from November to December 9 and negotiation committees will be set up to keep the talks ongoing. ""The TTP is ready for negotiations with the government for the restoration of durable peace in the entire country,"" Khurasani said in a statement. The announcement comes as a senior Afghan Taliban delegation, led by Afghanistan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, will travel to Pakistan on Wednesday. It's the first time an Afghan Taliban delegation will enter Pakistan as a government representative, since the group took control of the country in August. While the ceasefire talks are not on the agenda, the Afghan Taliban has played a role in facilitating the talks between the Pakistan Taliban and government, according to Chaudhry. The TTP have fought to overthrow Pakistan's government and replace it with an Islamist state since 2007. They are a distinct group from the Afghan Taliban, though they are closely linked -- as well as with al Qaeda -- and share a religious extremist ideology.The US State Department designates the TTP as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""Within Pakistan, TTP fighters often target members of Pakistan's armed forces, kill civilians for political and religious reasons, and attack foreign interests of Pakistan's allies.In September, three people died and 15 were injured in an attack on paramilitary troops in the city of Quetta in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan. The TTP claimed responsibility for the blast.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211109012815-army-public-school-attack-pakistan-2014-file-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/09/asia/pakistan-taliban-government-ceasefire-intl-hnk/index.html,2021-11-09T09:03.000Z,80.0,politics
22,Singapore prepares to rock softly as Covid music ban partially relaxed,"Singapore is lifting its controversial ban on music in restaurants and bars as part of an easing of coronavirus restrictions -- but authorities have warned business owners they must still keep the noise down.From Wednesday, food and beverage establishments can play ""soft recorded music,"" Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said at a news conference Monday. The ban, in place since June 18, was based on the rationale that loud or heavy background noise encourages people to speak louder -- increasing the risk of spreading Covid-19. Live music will remain banned.The rule had been met with criticism, especially from some in the Southeast Asian city-state's catering industry, which said it could hurt business. The change marks a relaxation of curbs that were reimposed in September, as Singapore -- which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world -- battled a surge in infections fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant. Singapore has vaccinated more than 82% of its 5.45 million population, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While it is still recording around 3,000 cases per day, most are asymptomatic or mild. According to the government, its Covid-19 expert committee is expected to make a recommendation later this month on use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, while about 50% of Singapore's population would have received booster shots by the end of the year.Under the eased restrictions, up to five fully vaccinated people from the same household will be allowed to dine together at restaurants and bars -- an increase from two, Trade Minister Gan Kim Yong said at the news conference Monday. ""With the situation stabilizing, we are now in a better position to ease some of the safe management efforts, without overwhelming our health care system,"" he said. Singapore will also allow quarantine-free travel for vaccinated people from neighboring Malaysia, as well as Sweden and Finland, authorities said, bringing the total number of countries it has quarantine-free arrangements with to 16.Jeremy Lim, associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore (NUS), said the lifting of restrictions is ""important to resuscitate a devastated food and beverage sector.""  ""The detail of the restrictions really reflects the penchant of the Singapore policy makers for precision and desire to control every factor possible,"" he said.Second easing of restrictionsWhen the pandemic began, Singapore pursued an aggressive ""zero-Covid"" policy, shutting its borders while imposing tight restrictions and social distancing rules. But in June, the government said it was planning to move toward a living with Covid strategy -- attempting to control outbreaks with vaccines and monitoring hospitalizations rather than restricting lives.In August, Singapore started to relax some restrictions, allowing fully vaccinated people to dine in restaurants and gather in groups of five, up from two. Workers gradually also resumed going to the office.But September's Delta outbreak put an end to those freedoms. Several curbs were reimplemented, including a return to the strict two-person rule.Now, citing the high vaccination rate and stabilization of new cases, authorities are gradually lifting  restrictions again, saying Singapore must do more to restore its connectivity with the world. Lim, from NUS, said Singapore has strengthened health facilities for future Covid surges, which could be one reason authorities are easing controls.  ""The world is opening up and Singapore is an obvious outlier based on vaccination rates versus restrictions,"" he said. ""Politically it's just much harder to justify the ongoing restrictions relative to other countries, especially since more and more quarantine-free travel is permitted."" He also pointed to restriction ""fatigue"" among Singapore residents.""Public sympathy for those unvaccinated by choice is wearing thin, thus allowing for relaxing of measures despite the increased risk to the unvaccinated,"" Lim said.Elsewhere in AsiaSingapore's ""living with Covid"" model reflects the strategy of several other Asian countries that are working toward treating the virus as endemic. Countries including Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia are looking to revive their economies via tourism and reopening businesses. Even India -- which battled a devastating second wave of infections -- opened to some vaccinated foreign tourists on October 15, as it continues with its aggressive vaccination drive. But one of Asia's biggest financial centers is absent from this growing list. Hong Kong closed its borders to non-residents at the start of the pandemic. It recently reopened to some foreign visitors, but it imposes tough quarantine of up to 21 days in a hotel for arrivals from countries its government deems high-risk, including the United States and the United Kingdom.The measures have been heavily criticized by business groups, which warn they threaten the Chinese territory's position as an international financial hub. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has repeatedly said the city will prioritize reopening its borders with mainland China over the rest of the world.

27,US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it.  Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014. If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.  Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development. ""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said. More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says. ""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region."" The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation. The lost value amounted to $96 million a year. Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society: Heat reduction: Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings, parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up."" Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams. Noise reduction:  Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits. Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says. Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property. Improved human health:  Many studies have found connections between exposure to nature and better mental and physical health. Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies. Doctors are even prescribing walks in nature for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with lower death rates. Wildlife habitat:  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life. Planning for treesNowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways."" Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being."" Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.  ""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""How you can help stop tree loss Protect what you have:  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true."" Prune the dead limbs out of your trees:  If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said. Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice. Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary:  Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow."" Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control. Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

29,How rich people could help save the planet from climate change,"Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change.Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by itBut some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference. Spend wiselyThe buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.    ""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. ""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. ""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.  ""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.Fund climate researchThe wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. ""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. Role models The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions. ""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters. ""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

42,"There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed","Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.No sleepTuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. ""Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,"" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. ""In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,"" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. ""We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,"" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls ""virtual railroads,"" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. ""If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,"" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the ""middle mile,"" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. ""A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,"" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. ""Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,"" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone. TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. ""The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,"" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. ""In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,"" said Lu. ""The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.""

43,A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuries,"Working in a factory or warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The ""Ironhand"" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a ""soft exoskeleton."" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Reducing fatigue""When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,"" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. ""It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.""The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called ""Robo-Glove,"" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. ""Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,"" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.""By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.""  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.""If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,"" says Krajcarski. ""But this is an exciting technology.""This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210423125914-20210423-traders-background-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/12/world/ironhand-exoskeleton-glove-spc-intl/index.html,2021-05-12T11:45.000Z,80.0,politics
44,This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it works,"In a Hong Kong warehouse, a swarm of autonomous robots works 24/7. They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination. A team tracks these movements and uses the data to improve their algorithms, making the robots more efficient.Robots have become commonplace in warehouses worldwide and Geek+ says it has more than 15,000 robots in over 30 countries, including in Nike and Decathlon warehouses.

51,This unique mentorship program helps students with learning differences realize 'their brains are beautiful',"Growing up, David Flink struggled in school -- despite his smarts.He had a hard time focusing in class, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.""There was a calculation made,"" he said. ""I could either be the dumb kid or I could be the bad kid. So, I started acting out.""Flink was often asked to leave the classroom because of the disruptions he caused.""At one point, my desk was literally moved to the hallway,"" he said. ""But then I had this message sent to me that I didn't belong in a classroom.""One in five children in the United States has a learning disability. At the time, Flink didn't realize he was among them, and his struggles left him feeling alone and isolated.It was in a hallway where Flink met his first mentor, the school's janitor. ""He got to know me, and eventually we started playing chess,"" Flink said. ""There was nothing that said he had to take an interest in my life, and he did anyhow. And that saved me.""At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University. When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability. They called the program Eye to Eye.""It was lightning in a bottle,"" Flink said of the program's early days. ""All of a sudden, all this stuff that we thought was really taboo and doesn't sound good -- we discovered they were just words. Under all of that was potential.""Since 1998, Eye to Eye has grown into a nationwide non-profit that pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference.  ""Middle school is actually the predictor of success,"" Flink said. ""It's where kids have the maturity to say, 'Hey, this is how my brain works. And I can ask for that thing.'"" Eye to Eye's curriculum utilizes art as a self-expression tool. Every activity in the 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.""It's incredible to see a classroom of our mentors and mentees,"" Flink said. ""They can be open and be themselves and that stigma is gone."" The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school. ""It's just crazy to me when we think about groups of students who are likely to fail, we don't look at the thing that they're showing up to do, which is learn,"" Flink said. ""This group has the highest dropout rate in our country. We can solve for that.""While Flink enjoys hearing about the academic success Eye to Eye brings to children, there's something more he finds gratifying.  ""When I hear that because they were in Eye to Eye, they now understand somebody else's experience better who's different than them -- this is what we need in America,"" Flink said. ""We have to love each other across our difference.""CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Flink about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: How has the pandemic affected your work? David Flink: When Covid first hit and suddenly we sent kids home, my biggest fear was that the kids who learned differently were going to be the first to suffer because they were already the ones who were suffering in school. So, we took our corps of mentors and we started deploying them virtually. It's taking the same secret sauce that was in person and providing it in a virtual format.CNN: What's special about the relationship between mentor and mentee? Flink: Every mentor and mentee relationship, of course, has its own unique DNA. But the thing that I keep seeing that is similar is, number one, there's this immediate sense of trust. They're different ages and different life experiences, and so why would they get along so well? But there's this immediate sense of trust and understanding that's just magical.The second thing was a surprise for me. The students come to meet in a community -- the mentees are meeting with their mentors and next to them there's another mentee meeting with their mentor. And so, while they may not be working directly together, they are working together in the same room. So just looking around, they feel this sense of sameness and of empowerment.CNN: What is your hope for the kids you're helping? Flink: My hope for the kids in Eye to Eye today is the exact same hope I had 21 years ago when I first stepped into a classroom to mentor. I want them to know that their brains are beautiful. I want them to know that they can achieve anything. I want them to leave feeling like they know how to ask for what they need. And that they can do it. And that's what we give them.Want to get involved?

And now you can vote on who you think should be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.To find out who is named Hero of the Year, you'll have to watch ""The 15th Annual CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute,"" hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa on Sunday, December 12, starting at 8 p.m. ET. CNN Heroes has been spotlighting the impactful work of people across the world since 2007. Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her countryHer cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said. She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means ""gratitude to the earth"" in Spanish.Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her workLynda Doughty: The seal rescuerHer cause:  For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.What inspired her:  Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.""I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life,"" Doughty said.She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.""I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals,"" Doughty said.She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.Read more about Lynda Doughty and her workDavid Flink: Creating a new way to learnHis cause:  David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference.

The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.""That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life,"" Gordon said. ""I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived.""What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.""There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable,"" she said.The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call ""See & Treat,"" screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.Read more about Dr. Patricia Gordon and her workHector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chanceHis cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.  What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.""Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications,"" Guadalupe said. ""Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up.""After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.Read more about Hector Guadalupe and his workMichele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief togetherHer cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.""It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward,"" Neff Hernandez said.What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.""I didn't even know what to do with myself,"" Neff Hernandez said. ""Every single thing about my life changed.""While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.""I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make,"" she said.Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her workZannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.""These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in,"" he said. ""Children ... are not even having this war.""What inspired him: Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.""(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his workShirley Raines: Beauty 2 the StreetzHer cause:  For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.Rain or shine, she sets up ""shop"" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls ""Kings"" and ""Queens."" Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.""I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together,"" Raines said.  Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.""I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together,"" she said.After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Read more about Shirley Raines and her workDr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoodsHer cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.What inspired her:  Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said.Read more about Dr. Ala Stanford and her workMade Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding familiesHis cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.  In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.""I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table,"" he said.

57,"World is on track for 2.4 degrees of warming despite COP26 pledges, analysis finds","The world is on track for 2.4 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels, if not more, according to a new analysis -- despite countries' new and updated climate pledges, including those made at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland.The watchdog Climate Action Tracker (CAT) warned on Tuesday that global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be roughly twice as high as what's necessary to limit warming to 1.5 degrees — a threshold scientists have said the planet should stay under to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. The net-zero goals of 40 countries account for 85% of global emissions cuts, but the group found only 6% of those emissions were backed up by concrete plans.""It's all very well for leaders to claim they have a net zero target, but if they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, in a statement. ""Glasgow has a serious credibility gap.""Delegates from around the world are gathering at COP26 to attempt to limit the climate crisis. While there were several breakthroughs in the first week of negotiations, experts warned the deals may not meet the urgency of the moment -- specifically, that they won't bring the world closer to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.""There's a lot of big statements, which don't have the details underneath: exactly when, how much, who's going to do what,"" said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics with the World Resources Institute.More than 130 countries that represent more than 85% of the planet's forests pledged last week to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030, in what was seen as the first big deal of the COP26 summit. When destroyed, forests can emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The agreement included some of the world largest carbon stocks locked away in tropical forests.In another breakthrough, more than 25 countries have so far signed on to an agreement to stop financing fossil fuel projects abroad. But critics say it doesn't go far enough and should include financing for fossil fuel projects at home, not just internationally.Christine Shearer, the program director for coal at Global Energy Monitor, called the deal ""a game changer,"" but stressed that fossil fuel projects must be stopped within these countries' own borders, too.Under current policies -- not proposals, but rather what countries are actually doing -- CAT projects global temperatures to climb to 2.7 degrees.If all net-zero pledges are fully implemented, CAT reported the most optimistic scenario would be warming of 1.8 degrees, which would require bold and rapid action by 2030. Still, countries' climate targets for 2030 remain inadequate, according to the analysis.

60,First images from NASA satellite which tracks climate changes released,"NASA has released the first snapshots of Earth taken with its new highly sensitive satellite which is designed to capture high-resolution images of the planet and help track the impacts of climate change.NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have been collecting images of our planet using satellites since 1972. The mission's most recent satellite, Landsat 9, launched in September this year, is equipped with two instruments that capture imagery and together provide experts with data about crop health, irrigation use, water quality, wildfire severity, deforestation, glacial retreat and, urban expansion.The Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) detects visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared light in nine wavelengths, the combination of which can give experts more information about things beyond what the human eye can observe, like the health of vegetation, or the strength of a wildfire.The satellite's other instrument, Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), observes thermal radiation in two wavelengths to measure Earth's surface temperatures and its changes, and can help experts track plant health.""Landsat 9's first images capture critical observations about our changing planet and will advance this joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey that provides critical data about Earth's landscapes and coastlines seen from space,"" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. ""This program has the proven power to not only improve lives but also save lives. NASA will continue to work with USGS to strengthen and improve accessibility to Landsat data so decision makers in America -- and around the world -- better understand the devastation of the climate crisis, manage agricultural practices, preserve precious resources and respond more effectively to natural disasters.""The first pictures show locations around the US, including Detroit in Michigan beside Lake St Clair, the intersection of cities and beaches on the changing Florida coastline, and observations from Navajo Country in Arizona ""that will add to the wealth of data helping us monitor crop health and manage irrigation water,"" NASA said.The snapshots also provide data about the changing landscapes of more of the world's crucial habitats, including the Himalayas in High Mountain Asia and the coastal islands and shorelines of northern Australia.Landsat 9 has several improvements on its predecessors: It transmits data with higher radiometric resolution back down to Earth, allowing it to detect more subtle differences over darker areas like water or dense forests. Landsat 9 can differentiate some 16,000 shades of a given wavelength color, while Landsat 7, the satellite being replaced, detects only 256. ""First light is a big milestone for Landsat users -- it's the first chance to really see the kind of quality that Landsat 9 provides. And they look fantastic,"" said Jeff Masek NASA's Landsat 9 project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center. Landsat 8 will remain in orbit, and together, the two satellites will report on changes to Earth every eight days.

64,"Phones of Palestinian NGO workers infected with Pegasus spyware, rights groups say ","Phones belonging to six people working for Palestinian NGOs were hacked with Israeli technology firm NSO Group's Pegasus spyware, rights groups say. Dublin-based rights group Front Line Defenders (FLD) said it began investigating the devices -- all iPhones -- last month after it was contacted by Ramallah-based civil society group Al Haq about a possible infection of a phone belonging to one of its staff. FLD went on to share its investigations with Amnesty International and Citizen Lab, both of which have conducted investigations into NSO Group spyware penetration. They confirmed the FLD's findings.The Palestinian NGOs include those designated as terrorist entities by Israel last month, a move that was sharply criticized by international donors who said the evidence used to back up the designations was unconvincing. Last week, the US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO Group, accusing it of enabling governments to ""silence dissent."" The rights groups who uncovered the hacking of staff at Palestinian NGOs have not accused any particular government of ordering the Pegasus hack, but in a joint statement referenced NSO Group's headquarters location in the Israeli city of Herzliya. ""NSO Group's headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, are less than a hundred kilometers from where the hacked Palestinian organizations work,"" the statement said. ""Not only has this technology been exported to countries where it has facilitated human rights abuse like Saudi Arabia and Mexico, but it is also being deployed locally and in some cases against Israeli [phone] numbers -- something which the NSO Group previously claimed was not possible."" In response, NSO Group said: ""Due to contractual and national security considerations, we cannot confirm or deny the identity of our government customers. As we stated in the past, NSO Group does not operate the products itself; the company license approved government agencies to do so, and we are not privy to the details of individuals monitored."" NSO Group says its spyware helps ""law enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world to defend the public from serious crime and terror."" Cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused NSO Group, in particular, of selling invasive and easy-to-use mobile hacking software to repressive governments.NSO Group's Pegasus spyware is said to have been used to spy on a journalist and activist in Morocco, the widow of a slain Mexican journalist and two women connected to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, among other targets, according to security researchers. US government officials have been concerned by the expansion of the market for hacking tools and the ability of foreign governments to quickly develop their own cyber capabilities using American expertise. In September, for example, the Justice Department announced charges against three former US intelligence and military operatives for allegedly helping build a hacking program for the United Arab Emirates government.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211109034623-03palestinian-ngo-workers-hacked-1108-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/09/middleeast/palestinian-ngos-nso-spyware-pegasus-intl/index.html,2021-11-09T10:51.000Z,80.0,politics
69,Campaigners make last effort to save man with intellectual disabilities from execution in Singapore,"Campaigners are making a last ditch effort to save a man with intellectual disabilities from execution in Singapore, in a case that has been described a ""sickening"" and a ""systemic failure,"" and put the city-state's zero-tolerance drug laws back under scrutiny. Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a 33-year-old Malaysian man, was arrested in 2009 for bringing 42.7 grams (1.5 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. He is due to be executed by hanging on Wednesday. The High Court dismissed a last minute constitutional challenge from his lawyer on Monday but granted a stay of execution so the decision could be appealed, lawyer M. Ravi posted on Facebook -- a small glimmer of hope for Dharmalingam's supporters.During the appeal hearing on Tuesday, the court ordered another stay of execution after announcing Dharmalingam tested positive for Covid-19, according to Ravi. The stay of execution will remain in place until the new appeal is heard.Dharmalingam's older sister, Sarmila Dharmalingham, said in a statement the family has been ""struggling"" but she is ""relieved"" to hear the execution had been stayed. ""But I'm only a little bit happy, because I know they haven't actually stopped the execution, only given it a temporary stay,"" she said. ""We have been told by the prison that we will not be allowed to visit him anymore, and that we will only be allowed phone calls with him.""Dharmalingam's lawyers and rights groups fighting to save him say Singapore is violating international law by executing a person with a mental impairment. They have exhausted all other legal appeals and a petition to the President for clemency was unsuccessful.Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement Dharmalingam ""was accorded full due process under the law, and was represented by legal counsel throughout the process.""However, his lawyers argue that Dharmalingam should not have been sentenced to death under Singaporean law because he was incapable of understanding his actions. A psychologist assessed his IQ to be 69, which is internationally recognized as an intellectual disability. At his trial, the defense also argued he had severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline intellectual functioning, and severe alcohol use disorder.Dharmalingam has spent a decade on death row and during that time his condition has further deteriorated, his lawyers said. ""He has not a very good sense of what is happening around him,"" said N. Surendran, a Malaysian lawyer who is representing Dharmalingam's family, and adviser to Malaysian NGO Lawyers for Liberty. ""He is disoriented. He's got no real clue of what is going to happen to him.""Surendran said executing Dharmalingam ""would be tantamount to executing a child.""Singapore has some of the strictest drug laws in the world. Trafficking a certain amount of drugs -- for example, 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of heroin -- results in a mandatory death sentence under the Misuse of Drugs Act. It was only recently -- and after Dharmalingam's case began -- the law was amended to allow for a convicted person to escape the death penalty in certain circumstances. Dharmalingam was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by Singapore's High Court in 2010. His first appeal was dismissed a year later. Another appeal after Singapore amended its drug law was again rejected in 2018.""The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court's decision and said that it was satisfied that Nagaenthran clearly understood the nature of his acts,"" the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement. The court argued Dharmalingam transported drugs ""in order to pay off his debts"" and he knew it was unlawful so he ""attempted to conceal the bundle by strapping it to his left thigh."" It also said Dharmalingam was ""continuously altering his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed.""""This was 'the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question.' Nagaenthran considered the risks, balanced it against the reward he had hoped he would get, and decided to take the risk,"" the ministry said in its statement, quoting the court's decision. Public pressureDharmalingam's case has sparked international condemnation -- even British Virgin boss Richard Branson has appealed for clemency.Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has written to his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsein Loong asking for leniency, Malaysian state media Bernama reported. More than 62,000 people have signed a petition urging Singapore's President Halimah Yacob to issue a pardon. Last week, dozens of activists protested outside Parliament in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (ADPAN) and other rights groups have also called on the Singapore government to halt the execution. ""Executing a man with a disability, who was convicted after an investigation and trial that provided no disability-specific accommodations, violates international law and won't deter crime,"" Emina Ćerimović, senior disability rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""Singapore should commute Nagaenthran Dharmalingam's sentence and amend its laws to ensure that no one is subjected to the death penalty, certainly not people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.""Surendran, the lawyer, said the execution order was ""sickening beyond belief.""He criticized the court for ordering the appeal hearings on Tuesday, arguing it gave little time prepare submissions overnight. ""These unreasonable court directions and unholy rush to have both hearings heard in less than 24 hours amounts to a blatant denial of due process to Nagaenthran contrary to Article 9 of the Singapore Constitution. No criminal justice system in any country which upholds the rule of law, rushes through criminal appeals in this manner; and all the more so in a death penalty case,"" he said. Family 'shocked'Dharmalingam's family, who live in Ipoh, northwestern Malaysia, were notified of his impending execution only on October 26. His lawyer in Singapore, M. Ravi posted the letter to Facebook, calling the order ""state sanctioned murder.""The letter stipulated only five members of Dharmalingam's family would be allowed to enter Singapore and would need to contend with a list of Covid regulations.Four family members -- his mother, brother, sister and a cousin -- managed to travel to Singapore and meet with Dharmalingam in Changi prison but were ""shocked"" at his condition, Surendran said. ""They see a completely different person, they're not able to get through to him,"" he said. Anti-death penalty activist Kirsten Han, launched a crowdfunding campaign that raised more than $19,000 Singapore dollars to pay for the family's flights and hotels.""This is not something that the family could have afforded themselves,"" she said. She said the execution order, made worse because it was issued shortly after the important Hindu festival Deepavali, which Dharmalingam's family celebrates, is ""very emblematic of how cold and clinical the entire death penalty regime is."" ""The Singapore government has insisted for a very long time that (the law) protects Singapore. But drug policy experts say there's no proof that this sort of punitive capital punishment regime deters drug trafficking,"" Han said.

71,Pakistan government and local Taliban agree to 'complete ceasefire' ,"The Pakistani government and the armed militant group the Pakistani Taliban have agreed to a one-month ceasefire while negotiations get underway to end years of bloodshed. Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry announced Monday a ""complete ceasefire"" was agreed with the group, known as the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP is a banned Islamist group that is responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in Pakistan's history, including an assault on an army-run school in 2014 that killed 132 children, as well as the 2012 attempt to kill schoolgirl Malala Yousufzai, who became a Nobel laureate and education rights activist. In a statement, Chaudhry said talks with the TTP are ""underway"" and a truce will be extended as the talks progress. He said negotiations are in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan.Talks will focus on ""state sovereignty, national security, peace in conflict zones along with social and economic stability,"" Chaudhry said.""It is heartening that there will be peace in these conflict ridden areas,"" he said. TPP spokesperson Muhammad Khurasani said both sides would observe a one-month ceasefire from November to December 9 and negotiation committees will be set up to keep the talks ongoing. ""The TTP is ready for negotiations with the government for the restoration of durable peace in the entire country,"" Khurasani said in a statement. The announcement comes as a senior Afghan Taliban delegation, led by Afghanistan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, will travel to Pakistan on Wednesday. It's the first time an Afghan Taliban delegation will enter Pakistan as a government representative, since the group took control of the country in August. While the ceasefire talks are not on the agenda, the Afghan Taliban has played a role in facilitating the talks between the Pakistan Taliban and government, according to Chaudhry. The TTP have fought to overthrow Pakistan's government and replace it with an Islamist state since 2007. They are a distinct group from the Afghan Taliban, though they are closely linked -- as well as with al Qaeda -- and share a religious extremist ideology.The US State Department designates the TTP as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""Within Pakistan, TTP fighters often target members of Pakistan's armed forces, kill civilians for political and religious reasons, and attack foreign interests of Pakistan's allies.In September, three people died and 15 were injured in an attack on paramilitary troops in the city of Quetta in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan.

73,Singapore prepares to rock softly as Covid music ban partially relaxed,"Singapore is lifting its controversial ban on music in restaurants and bars as part of an easing of coronavirus restrictions -- but authorities have warned business owners they must still keep the noise down.From Wednesday, food and beverage establishments can play ""soft recorded music,"" Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said at a news conference Monday. The ban, in place since June 18, was based on the rationale that loud or heavy background noise encourages people to speak louder -- increasing the risk of spreading Covid-19. Live music will remain banned.The rule had been met with criticism, especially from some in the Southeast Asian city-state's catering industry, which said it could hurt business. The change marks a relaxation of curbs that were reimposed in September, as Singapore -- which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world -- battled a surge in infections fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant. Singapore has vaccinated more than 82% of its 5.45 million population, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While it is still recording around 3,000 cases per day, most are asymptomatic or mild. According to the government, its Covid-19 expert committee is expected to make a recommendation later this month on use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, while about 50% of Singapore's population would have received booster shots by the end of the year.Under the eased restrictions, up to five fully vaccinated people from the same household will be allowed to dine together at restaurants and bars -- an increase from two, Trade Minister Gan Kim Yong said at the news conference Monday. ""With the situation stabilizing, we are now in a better position to ease some of the safe management efforts, without overwhelming our health care system,"" he said. Singapore will also allow quarantine-free travel for vaccinated people from neighboring Malaysia, as well as Sweden and Finland, authorities said, bringing the total number of countries it has quarantine-free arrangements with to 16.Jeremy Lim, associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore (NUS), said the lifting of restrictions is ""important to resuscitate a devastated food and beverage sector.""  ""The detail of the restrictions really reflects the penchant of the Singapore policy makers for precision and desire to control every factor possible,"" he said.Second easing of restrictionsWhen the pandemic began, Singapore pursued an aggressive ""zero-Covid"" policy, shutting its borders while imposing tight restrictions and social distancing rules. But in June, the government said it was planning to move toward a living with Covid strategy -- attempting to control outbreaks with vaccines and monitoring hospitalizations rather than restricting lives.In August, Singapore started to relax some restrictions, allowing fully vaccinated people to dine in restaurants and gather in groups of five, up from two. Workers gradually also resumed going to the office.But September's Delta outbreak put an end to those freedoms. Several curbs were reimplemented, including a return to the strict two-person rule.Now, citing the high vaccination rate and stabilization of new cases, authorities are gradually lifting  restrictions again, saying Singapore must do more to restore its connectivity with the world. Lim, from NUS, said Singapore has strengthened health facilities for future Covid surges, which could be one reason authorities are easing controls.  ""The world is opening up and Singapore is an obvious outlier based on vaccination rates versus restrictions,"" he said. ""Politically it's just much harder to justify the ongoing restrictions relative to other countries, especially since more and more quarantine-free travel is permitted."" He also pointed to restriction ""fatigue"" among Singapore residents.""Public sympathy for those unvaccinated by choice is wearing thin, thus allowing for relaxing of measures despite the increased risk to the unvaccinated,"" Lim said.Elsewhere in AsiaSingapore's ""living with Covid"" model reflects the strategy of several other Asian countries that are working toward treating the virus as endemic. Countries including Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia are looking to revive their economies via tourism and reopening businesses. Even India -- which battled a devastating second wave of infections -- opened to some vaccinated foreign tourists on October 15, as it continues with its aggressive vaccination drive. But one of Asia's biggest financial centers is absent from this growing list. Hong Kong closed its borders to non-residents at the start of the pandemic. It recently reopened to some foreign visitors, but it imposes tough quarantine of up to 21 days in a hotel for arrivals from countries its government deems high-risk, including the United States and the United Kingdom.The measures have been heavily criticized by business groups, which warn they threaten the Chinese territory's position as an international financial hub. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has repeatedly said the city will prioritize reopening its borders with mainland China over the rest of the world.

88,Penis worms were the hermit crabs of their time,"In the depths of ancient seas more than 500 million years ago, phallic-shaped creatures known as penis worms commandeered empty shells to protect themselves from predators -- the earliest evidence of behavior best known today in hermit crabs. That penis worms lived like hermit crabs was revealed by analysis of fossils found in Yunnan province in southern China that date back to the Cambrian Period. The fossils preserved the soft tissue of four penis worms called Eximipriapulus, as well as material from conical-shaped shells that once belong to animals called hyoliths.""The worms are always sitting snugly within these same types of shells, in the same position and orientation,"" said Martin Smith, associate professor in palaeontology at the University of Durham in the UK, in a statement. He was a coauthor of  a study on the fossils that published in the journal Current Biology on Monday.""The only explanation that made sense was that these shells were their homes -- something that came as a real surprise,"" Smith said. Hermiting behavior had been thought to evolve much later -- in the Jurassic Period about 170 million years ago -- deep into the time of the dinosaurs. Behavior is one of the hardest things to infer from the fossil record. So how did researchers know for sure that the worms weren't using the shells as a temporary shelter, or while laying eggs, or as refuge from an environmental condition that caused their death? ""This was the big question we had to convince ourselves of in this study,"" Smith said via email. ""First we showed that the worms were actually inside the shells -- between the upper and lower surfaces,"" he said. ""This shows that biology must have been responsible, rather than post-mortem processes.""Beyond this, there are two key observations: the first, that there are no worms in the deposit that are not found within shells, which we would expect if the relationship was temporary or opportunistic,"" he added. ""Secondly, that the size match was consistent: worms are always found in a shell that's just big enough to accommodate them (but no bigger),"" he wrote. ""Like goldilocks, they seem to have chosen the shell that was 'just right' for them."" Cambrian Period surprisesWhen these worms existed, the world was a very different place. The continents were strung out along the equator and nothing much lived on land except for a ""thin sludge of microscopic organisms,"" Smith said. However, the oceans had begun to teem with life. ""It's mind-boggling that we start to see the complex and dangerous ecologies usually associated with much younger geological periods so soon after the first complex (marine) animals arrive on the scene,"" he said. The researchers also concluded that predators in this era must have been plentiful and aggressive, forcing the worms, which were 1 to 2 centimeters long and the width of a string, to take shelter in the empty shells. While their findings rest on a small number of fossil specimens, the fact that this kind of sheltering behavior -- which the researchers term a ""modern lifestyle"" -- existed has reinforced a growing sense that animal behavior and ecosystems in this time were ""more contemporary in character than had traditionally been assumed."" Hermiting has evolved in a number of different animals in addition to hermit crabs, including some other crustaceans and various types of marine worms, the paper said. Today, penis worms are only found in settings where it's hard for predators to get a foothold, Smith said. Some are tiny and live between individual grains of sand. Others live in stinking, oxygen depleted and partially toxic waters. And they no longer take refuge in shells.""None are 'hermits,' one of the reasons that our results are so surprising -- we often (wrongly) think of evolution as always moving in the direction of generating complexity, whilst forgetting that complex solutions once invented are sometimes lost.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/08/world/penis-worms-fossils-shells-scn/index.html,2021-11-08T18:00.000Z,80.0,politics
90,India accuses Pakistan navy of murder following fisherman's death,"India is accusing a guard branch of the Pakistan navy of murder, following the death of a 32-year-old fisherman at sea on Saturday, Indian police in the coastal state of Gujarat told CNN Monday. The incident occurred on a fishing boat called ""JALPARI"" which was allegedly fired upon by Pakistani maritime forces, resulting in the death of Sridhar Chamre, senior police official Sunil Joshi told CNN. Chamre died as the result of a ""bullet injury,"" preliminary post-mortem reports showed, while another fisherman on board sustained a minor injury during the firing, Joshi said. There were a total of seven fishermen on board when the gunfire broke out. Indian police in Porbandar, a coastal city to the west of Gujarat, registered the incident Sunday, accusing Pakistani navy commandos of murder under sections of the Indian Arms Act, Joshi said.Porbandar police station handled the complaint as it is the only police station in the country authorized to register incidents that take place beyond 12 nautical miles off India's coastline. The Indian government has taken ""serious note of the incident"" and intends to handle the issue ""diplomatically"" with Pakistan, a source within the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) told CNN Monday. The country has summoned a senior Pakistani diplomat over the alleged killing, the MEA source later added.""A senior diplomat from the High Commission of Pakistan was summoned ... and a strong protest was lodged on the incident of unprovoked firing at Indian fishermen by the Pakistan side,"" the source explained.The Indian government has ""condemned this deplorable action by a Pakistani agency ... causing loss of life, which is in contravention to all established international practices and bilateral understandings,"" the source continued.The Pakistani government has been asked to conduct an inquiry and ""instruct its forces to refrain from such acts of unprovoked firing"" they added. The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) responded to the incident on Twitter, saying it had no knowledge of the fisherman's death.  ""PMSA is unaware of any incident where someone has been killed or injured ... PMSA has no knowledge about the boat JALPARI or its crew,"" the agency tweeted Monday.

92,"Communists have now left the Czech parliament, more than three decades after the Velvet Revolution","When the Czech Republic's 200 newly-elected deputies gathered for the inaugural session of its new parliament on Monday, there wasn't a single Communist party member there -- for the first time in 76 years.  The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), the direct successor of the totalitarian Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, has dropped out of the lower house of the Czech parliament after failing to gain any seats in last month's election. The party lost its last seat in the upper house, the Senate, in 2018.The final departure of the Communists from the top levels of Czech politics marks a hugely symbolic moment for many survivors of the totalitarian regime, especially after the outgoing government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis breached a long-standing taboo and relied on the votes of the Communists in the parliament to secure a majority in 2018, giving them indirect access to power. While the party has attempted to re-brand itself as a modern and democratic leftist group in recent years, it never fully removed its association with the acts of its totalitarian predecessor. Marek Benda -- of the Civic Democratic Party and the country's longest serving Member of Parliament -- said he never expected the Communists to stay in parliament for so long after the revolution. ""We thought that they would still have some voters, but that these would gradually disappear ... but they were doing quite well for much longer,"" Benda said.  Jan Rovny, an associate professor at Sciences Po in Paris, said the decline of the party is down mostly to the ""demographic replacement of its elder voters, nostalgic for communist regime certainties."" But, writing in a policy blog, Rovny said the rise of populist parties like Babis' ANO and the far-right SPD have also contributed to the Communists' downfall.""From its heyday at the helm of the authoritarian regime, the KSCM has been reduced to a radical left protest party in the post-1989 democracy,"" he wrote. ""The recent rise of cultural themes, centering on fears of migration advanced by the SPD and increasingly by ANO, has changed the substance of protest politics. The party's core districts in the post-industrial northern regions have shifted allegiance.""KSCM's leadership resigned following the party's election defeat. Jiri Dolejs, a member of the KSCM board, told CNN that the party's demise reflects a wider downfall of the left in Europe, pointing to other groups that have suffered losses, such as Germany's Die Linke.""The left has been competing with populists, migration and health crises have pushed away the traditional competition between the left and the right,"" he said. Vojtech Filip, the outgoing former KSCM leader, told Halo Noviny, a Czech leftist newspaper closely tied to the party: ""It is a great disappointment. The [election] debacle of the KSCM means that for the first time in modern history, the Communist Party will not be part of parliamentary democracy in the Czech Republic. The communists now face the task of doing everything in their power to regain prominence,"" The group's newly-installed leader, Katerina Konecna, said her priority would be working to gain more support among younger people. According to the party's official newspaper, the average age of KSCM members is now 75. 'Very much stuck in the old ways'Benda was one of the student leaders of the 1989 revolution and entered parliament shortly after the fall of the communist regime. ""When I first entered the parliament, there were 70 of us new deputies and 130 of the old guys,"" he told CNN.  ""It was quite extreme, some of the old members were the real, old-school comrades. Of course the worst people were thrown out, but those that remained were still very much stuck in the old ways.""He said that as a 21-year-old, he was addressed in an informal way by many of the old-school Communists, something he said he ""just couldn't get used to.""Benda said he sees the final exit of KSCM from the Czech parliament as a ""huge success."" ""Especially because it happened in a democratic way, they fizzled out on their own,"" he added. The MP said there was no appetite for the party to be banned after the revolution: ""The atmosphere was not one of revenge and the West was also not supportive of the idea of making the party illegal.""While it took 32 years for KSCM to drop out of parliament, the group's final exit is more symbolic coming in 2021, a century after the original Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was formed.

98,French police officer survives stabbing attack in Cannes,"A policeman survived a knife attack in the French Riviera city of Cannes on Monday, according to the country's interior minister. The incident took place early Monday morning as four police officers outside Cannes police station were preparing to go on patrol, Gerald Darmanin told reporters. The assailant approached the officers asking for information before opening the door of the vehicle they were in and stabbing one of the officers in the chest with a knife, the minister said. The attacker then attempted to stab a second officer before he was neutralized. Darmanin said the officer emerged from the incident unscathed as he was protected by a bulletproof vest, adding that while he was ""not harmed physically,"" he is ""extremely psychologically shocked."" An official inquiry has been launched following the attack, but Darmanin told reporters it would not be handled by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor.The minister added that the assailant is a 37-year-old Algerian passport holder who arrived in Europe around 2009-10 and has been in France since 2016, having traveled from Italy where he had a residence permit.  Darmanin said the attacker had been trying to obtain a French resident card for ""several weeks"" but had not been granted one. The assailant suffered unspecified injuries and is currently ""between life and death"" at Cannes hospital. He had no previous criminal record in France, said Darmanin.The mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, called the attack ""serious"" and ""revolting"" while speaking to CNN affiliate BFM TV Monday. Lisnard stressed the importance of not ""ceding to anger"" or ""trivializing this type of attack.""Éric Ciotti, an MP for the Alpes-Maritimes region who is hoping to run in next spring's French presidential election as the candidate for the right-wing Republicans party, labeled the incident as a ""terrorist attack"" on Twitter, without offering any further explanation.

103,"This ancient sloth ate meat, unlike its plant-eating relatives","Modern sloths hang out in trees, move at a slow pace and eat a vegetarian diet -- but the same thing can't be said for their extinct relative, Mylodon. This ancient ground sloth, which lived in South America until about 10,000 years ago, chowed down on meat as well as plants, making it an omnivore. The finding, rooted in new research, contradicts previous scientific understanding of the giant extinct creatures.""Whether they were sporadic scavengers or opportunistic consumers of animal protein can't be determined from our research, but we now have strong evidence contradicting the long-standing presumption that all sloths were obligate herbivores,"" said lead study author Julia Tejada, American Museum of Natural History research associate and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Montpellier, France, in a statement. There are only six sloth species alive today, and all of them can be found living in the trees of tropical rainforests in Central and South America. But ancient ground sloths were another story. Some of them reached the size of elephants and lived in a broad range of habitats, from Alaska to the tip of South America. The sloth in the study, known as Darwin's ground sloth, or Mylodon darwinii, likely reached 10 feet (3 meters) in length and weighed between 2,220 and 4,400 pounds (1,007 and 1,996 kilograms). Analysis of the jaws and teeth preserved as fossils from ancient sloths, as well as fossilized poop, have always suggested Mylodon and other extinct ground sloths ate plants like their modern counterparts. However, these clues don't reveal the entire story of what an animal ate during its lifetime, especially if that animal was scavenging. New evidence from chemical detective workThe researchers conducted a chemical analysis of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, that were preserved in the hair from Mylodon specimens. When an animal eats specific foods, nitrogen isotopes are trapped inside amino acids, which then leave a trace inside body tissue, like hair or nails, and collagen, which can be found in bones and teeth. The nitrogen isotope signals can show if an animal was an herbivore, carnivore or omnivore. In this case, the analysis revealed the giant ground sloth ate meat as well as plants. The researchers refer to the sloth as an ""opportunistic omnivore,"" meaning that it may have scavenged from carcasses of other animals or ingested animal protein from eggs.In addition to studying Mylodon's hair, the researchers analyzed samples from seven species of sloth and their close anteater relatives, both living and extinct for comparison. The team also studied a wide range of modern omnivores. Another extinct sloth the scientists studied, a ground sloth called Nothrotheriops shastensis that once lived in North America, was determined to be an herbivore. But Mylodon stood out as a clear omnivore.Previous research has suggested there wasn't enough vegetation to support all of the herbivores living at the time across South America, so Mylodon may have turned to other food sources. The new study supports that hypothesis.""These results, providing the first direct evidence of omnivory in an ancient sloth species, demands reevaluation of the entire ecological structure of ancient mammalian communities in South America, as sloths represented a major component of these ecosystems across the past 34 million years,"" Tejada said.The study published in October in the journal Scientific Reports.

Fred Upton on Monday shared a threatening voicemail he had received after voting for the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week. In the voicemail, which Upton played during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on ""AC360,"" a caller told the Michigan Republican: ""I hope you die. I hope everybody in your f**king family dies,"" while labeling him a ""f**king piece of sh*t traitor.""Upton was one of just 13 House Republicans who voted with Democrats on Friday to pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill after hours of delays and debating among Democrats. The legislation, which passed the Senate in August, will deliver $550 billion in new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. Following the Friday vote, Upton tweeted in part, ""I regret that this good, bipartisan bill became a political football in recent weeks. Our country can't afford this partisan dysfunction any longer.""On Monday evening, he told Cooper, ""I'll tell you it's a terrible way -- we have seen civility really downslide here. I'm concerned about my staff. They are taking these calls.""""These are very disturbing, adult language,"" he added.

115,These veterans swore to defend the Constitution; now they're facing jail time for the US Capitol riot,"More than 70 current and former members of the US military, who all swore an oath to defend the Constitution, are now facing criminal charges and special attention from prosecutors for attacking their own democracy by storming the US Capitol on January 6. For these defendants, many with decorated combat records and multiple overseas deployments, their military service has become a double-edged sword in their legal cases. The Justice Department has argued that rioters' veteran status is an aggravating factor, and some judges have held veterans to a higher standard while considering whether to send them to jail, either as punishment for their crimes or while their cases play out.  Retired Sgt. Jeffrey McKellop, a 23-year Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was charged with assaulting police with a flagpole. He pleaded not guilty but has been in jail since March. District Judge Carl Nichols said his military service shows ""he should have known better"" and ruled against releasing him before trial.""I really credit his military service. It's really remarkable, and I thank him for it,"" Nichols said at a recent detention hearing. ""But it suggests that he should have known better. I am more concerned about his conduct that day than I might have been if it was some random person."" But other veterans who were charged with violent crimes were released from jail shortly after their arrest. And some veterans have successfully pushed for leniency, because of their valiant battlefield experiences, or due to injuries they received while serving their country, including PTSD.   For instance, the chief judge of DC's federal court balked when prosecutors requested a monthlong jail term for a retired lieutenant colonel who pleaded to a nonviolent misdemeanor. ""It surprises me that the government is holding that service -- that, I think, most Americans would have enormous respect for -- against this man,"" Chief Judge Beryl Howell said about Leonard Gruppo, before sentencing him to three months of house arrest, probation and a $3,000 fine. More than 650 people have been charged by the Justice Department in the January 6 insurrection, and about 1 in 10 defendants served in the military, according to CNN's analysis of Pentagon records and court filings. A quarter of the veterans facing charges have alleged ties to far-right extremist groups, like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, which recruit ex-military and retired police officers.  At a hearing for alleged Oath Keeper Joshua James, Judge Amit Mehta said it was ""mystifying"" that James had played ""an active role"" in the assault, given the Purple Heart he had earned in Iraq. James has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and other felony charges, and was released before trial.""It really does cut against what I think you stand for, and what this country is all about,"" Mehta said.     Veterans behind bars It hasn't always worked, but federal prosecutors have repeatedly argued in court that the veteran-rioters deserve harsher treatment. After all, they swore an oath to defend the Constitution when they joined the military, but they aided an attempted coup on January 6.   McKellop's defense attorney acknowledged that he ""probably should have known better"" because of his experience in the Special Forces and later as a contractor for the CIA. Nichols, the judge, said he was afraid McKellop might fight with police again if released.  ""One would think that someone who respects the rule of law wouldn't swing a flag with a tip at police officers, and cut them, and then throw it like a spear,"" said Nichols, an appointee of former President Donald Trump.  Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey reached a similar conclusion about retired Spc. Robert Morss, who served in Afghanistan with the Army Rangers. Videos released by the Justice Department show Morss taking on an impromptu leadership role with his fellow rioters, coordinating their movements and passing back stolen police shields that they could use to protect themselves. At a detention hearing in July, Harvey ruled that Morss should stay in jail before trial, in part because he was ""willing to use his training or experience to organize with the rioters"" to subvert democracy, ""thereby making their actions more effective, more forceful and more violent."" Morss has pleaded not guilty. Other prominent veterans facing charges have been behind bars essentially all year. They include former Pvt. Jessica Watkins, the Ohio bar owner who is charged in the Oath Keepers conspiracy case, and Sgt. Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, whose colleagues said he was an outspoken Nazi sympathizer at the Navy base where he worked. Both have pleaded not guilty. 'I can't bring myself to do that' Plenty of other veterans found more receptive audiences when asking judges to cut them a break. Many factors play a role in detention decisions, including the history and characteristics of the defendant, which gave veterans a platform to tout their heroic service for their country.   One federal judge released former Marine Sgt. Michael Foy from jail in part because of his ""history of respect for and compliance with authority,"" though she added that Foy had violated his oath to the Constitution.  Gruppo, the retired lieutenant colonel, spent time in four war zones as a decorated medical officer. He was a liaison to Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf during the Gulf War and saw front-line combat in the Iraq War, trying to save wounded troops during the 2007 surge. At his sentencing hearing, prosecutors hit a wall when they tried to use his 27-year military career against him. ""I just don't view his military service that way. I can't bring myself to do that,"" said Howell, the chief judge in DC's federal court, a self-described ""Army brat"" who was born on a military base. She praised Gruppo's service as ""heroic"" and said she was ""not sure most of the (prosecutors) sitting at the government's table would ever be able to survive"" what he had gone through overseas. At every step of the way, defense attorneys have put any disabilities front and center in their legal arguments.  A judge kept former Lance Cpl. Alex Harkrider out of jail because, in large part, he said he was uncomfortable putting someone with PTSD behind bars without his service dog. And the Justice Department didn't request detention for Mark Leffingwell -- whose lawyer said he ""got blown up in Iraq"" while in the National Guard -- even though he punched a police officer on January 6. Marine Corps Maj. Christopher Warnagiris, who was on active duty and stationed in Virginia on January 6, was indicted on felony charges for allegedly shoving a police officer while trying to hold open the Capitol doors. He pleaded not guilty, and prosecutors didn't object to his release.'I broke that oath,' veteran says There's also a split among the veterans themselves, as they grapple with the fallout from January 6. Some have publicly slammed investigators and peddled conspiracy theories, while others have offered emotional apologies and owned up to their roles in the insurrection.As the Justice Department moves to resolve the hundreds of federal cases, more than a dozen veterans have pleaded guilty to charges connected to the insurrection, according to CNN's tally. Some veterans have used plea and sentencing hearings to apologize and take responsibility. At Gruppo's sentencing, he said it was ""a huge mistake"" to go to the Capitol. He apologized to the police, congressional leaders, ""both presidents"" and his family, adding, ""I am ashamed."" Thomas Vinson struck a similar tone: ""I signed up for the Air Force to take care of and defend this country,"" he said. ""I took that oath to the Constitution. and I know I broke that oath that day by entering that building and participating in the events of January 6. It's a blemish that's going to be on myself, my family, for the rest of my life, and the country, and into the history books.""    When Jonathan Sanders, a decorated former master sergeant in the Air Force, was sentenced to a misdemeanor last week, he told the judge that he ""failed"" his extensive military training. ""That was a personal failure on my part. I wasn't coerced, I wasn't tricked, I wasn't pushed,"" he said. ""...That failure on my part is uncharacteristic. I know that my family, my friends, the men and women I served with and especially the men and women who trained me expected better."" Both men got probation, even though their convictions could've led to six-month jail terms. Conspiracies and delusions Other rioters have flocked to right-wing outlets to falsely claim that the Justice Department is unfairly targeting service members because they support Trump. These claims have helped some defendants capture online fandom and sympathy from conservatives. Micajah Jackson, a former Marine with ties to the Proud Boys, was a featured speaker at a ""Justice for J6"" rally in Phoenix, CNN reported. He pushed the false-flag theory that the FBI had colluded with police and left-wing groups to orchestrate the attack on the Capitol.  In an October interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell said the Justice Department ""made me the poster boy"" of the Oath Keepers and that the case against him was ""total claptrap."" His wife, Sharon Caldwell, said he has ""given everything for this country that he loves,"" and solicited donations for a legal defense fund. Similarly, former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Mark Ibrahim went on Fox News and claimed he had gone to the Capitol because a ""friend I served in Iraq with"" in the Army had asked him to help film the riot ""so those criminals could face justice."" He also claimed he had been fired from the DEA for attending the pro-Trump rally, and his story instantly went viral on conservative social media. But prosecutors said Ibrahim's claims on Fox News were a fabrication -- and that he had repeated his story to the FBI, leading to a criminal charge of lying to investigators. He pleaded not guilty.

116,New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu declines Senate bid in significant blow for Republicans,"New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu on Tuesday said he would not run against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in 2022, dealing a significant blow to Republicans who hoped the seat would be a top target in the critical midterm elections.Sununu, who said he was running for a fourth term as governor, offered a wholesale criticism of the US Senate in his announcement, deriding the legislative body as slow and largely ineffective, contrasting that with the ""expectations,"" ""accountability,"" and ""successes"" demanded of governors.""I'd rather push myself 120 miles an hour delivering wins for New Hampshire than to slow down, end up on Capitol Hill debating partisan politics without results. That's why I am going to run for a fourth term,"" Sununu said.After listing all he has done in New Hampshire and what he hopes to accomplish, Sununu added, ""There is just so much that we can do but a US senator does none of this. A governor must be accountable and deliver results. It's what I've done, it's how I can best serve New Hampshire and defend its values.""National Republicans for months had hoped Sununu would take on Hassan, a first-term senator who was the current governor's predecessor.Sununu was seen as the top Republican recruit nationwide: He won reelection in 2020 by 32 percentage points in a state where President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by 7 points. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, have both publicly said they hoped Sununu would run.But his decision to seek a fourth term delivered a blow to both Senate Republicans.Sununu told reporters that he did not tell McConnell or Scott that he was passing on a Senate bid.""I guess you will have to let them know. I haven't talked to them,"" he said, adding that he was appreciative of their work to get him to run but that his decision ""is about New Hampshire, not about Washington.""""Unbelievable,"" McConnell political adviser Josh Holmes tweeted shortly after Sununu's announcement.Republicans grew hopeful after their recent win in the Virginia gubernatorial race and a stunning near-miss in New Jersey's gubernatorial contest that more top recruits like Sununu would jump into key races as they see the national political environment shifting in the GOP's favor. But Sununu's decision clearly came down to whether he wanted to be one of 100 legislators or the leader of his state. Sununu delivered his decision with a stinging rebuke of the Senate.""The more I heard about the opportunities that would be there to lead, and there are opportunities to be sure, what the day to day entails, it is so different, it doesn't fit, not just my style, but it clearly doesn't fit the needs of the citizens,"" Sununu said, revealing that numerous senators called him to give him advice, along with former President George W. Bush.He added: ""If we are just sitting around having meeting after meeting, waiting for votes to maybe happen. Man, I like moving, I like getting stuff done. ... I think I would be like a lion in a cage waiting to get something and affect real change. It just wasn't for me.""Sununu, 47, is the son of one former New Hampshire governor and White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the brother of a former senator, John E. Sununu. He has been elected to three consecutive two-year terms as governor in 2016, 2018 and 2020. In recent months, Sununu has been coy about whether he would seek a fourth term as governor or would run for the Senate instead.Hassan won by 1,017 votes in 2016, and protecting her seat is critical to Democrats' hopes of maintaining the majority in the Senate, which is currently split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. An October poll by the University of New Hampshire showed a potentially close race, with Sununu narrowly ahead of Hassan, 45% to 42%.Democrats were clearly concerned about a Hassan-Sununu race. The party previewed its lines of attack against Sununu ahead of his announcement, arguing he has never faced an opponent as well-funded and widely known as Hassan. Sununu told reporters that he is hopeful Republicans will be able to defeat Hassan, but even the party's top operatives admit that their chances for success took a hit with Sununu's decision.In September, Trump released a statement praising another Republican candidate in the Senate race, retired Gen. Don Bolduc, after Bolduc's interview on Fox News criticizing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. ""Congratulations to General Don Bolduc on his incredible presentation regarding Mark Milley, the Taliban and China's all-time favorite General!"" Trump said.

117,"Behind political polarization, there's a complex picture of partisans","Hidden beneath the stark partisan polarization of American politics today are sharp intraparty divisions over some of the most central issues facing the nation, according to a new analysis from the Pew Research Center. The study assesses the public's views on a range of issues and segments Americans into nine groups, largely divided along partisan lines. Four fall mostly within the Democratic Party and another four mostly into the Republican Party, with the final group made up of largely disengaged Americans who are less clearly aligned with either side. The groups within each party are distinguished by their ideological positions, their demographic makeup and their level of political engagement. And the analysis reveals that the coalitions that form within parties can vary based on the issue at hand. According to Pew, ""the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions -- and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one.""Despite the sharp partisan polarization that dominates opinions on most issues, the research reveals some similar patterns across parties. Both see lower overall engagement and partisan connection among the youngest subsets of their parties. The ideological ends of each side of the spectrum include those who are most engaged. And the internal rifts within both parties have shifted somewhat since the last Pew typology report four years ago.Here's a look at what unites and divides each of the two major parties in American politics. The RepublicansThe Republican Party, the Pew report finds, faces internal divides over ""some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for low taxes and opposition to abortion."" And there is some division within the party over how to handle criticism of former President Donald Trump. But they're largely in sync in their desire for a smaller government and their rejection of the idea that the country still struggles with systemic racial and gender inequality.Pew's analysis reveals four subsets of the Republican Party:""Faith and Flag Conservatives"" (about 23% of the GOP) are older, politically active and overwhelmingly Christian, as well as ""intensely conservative in all realms.""The ""Populist Right"" (about 23%) have less formal education, live more rurally and express wariness of both immigrants and big business.The ""Ambivalent Right"" (about 18%), a younger and less-doctrinaire group, feels weaker ties to the Republican Party, but maintains conservative attitudes on race, gender and the role of government.And ""Committed Conservatives"" (about 15%), are highly educated and politically active Republicans whose ideological principles take on a ""somewhat softer edge"" on issues like immigration and international relations.Across those cohorts, there are some clear lines of agreement:A rejection of concerns about racial and gender-based injustice. In all four of the Republican-affiliated typology groups, fewer than one-quarter say that a lot more needs to be done to ensure equal rights for Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Two-thirds or more in each group dismiss the idea that White Americans benefit from societal advantages that Black Americans do not. More than 6 in 10 say that the obstacles that once made it harder for women than men to get ahead are now largely gone. Most also consider ""people too easily taking offense to things others say"" to be a major problem in the US.A preference for smaller government. Two-thirds or more in every group say that government is doing too many things best left to businesses and individuals, and most say it's not the government's job to protect people from themselves.A focus on military strength. All four groups want to see the US work to remain the world's sole military superpower, and about one-tenth in any of the groups think the size of the military should be reduced.But there are defining differences:Whether they believe the economic system is fair. Just 17% of Republicans in the ""Populist Right"" -- compared with 70% or more in the other three groups -- agree that most corporations make a fair and reasonable amount of profit. The ""Populist Right"" also stands out for its majority support on raising tax rates for high income households.Where they stand on issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion. While two-thirds of the ""Faith and Flag Conservatives"" say that the legality of same-sex marriage in the US is bad for society, half or fewer of the other groups agree. And while 84% of ""Faith and Flag Conservatives"" say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, only 44% in the ""Ambivalent Right"" agree.How they feel about immigration. The ""Populist Right"" and ""Faith and Flag Conservatives"" take hardline views against immigrants, including those who enter the country legally -- more than 80% in both groups ""say that illegal immigration is a very big national problem,"" and significant shares want to see fewer immigrants legally admitted into the US.How to handle Trump. Asked to rate their feelings about the former President on a 0 to 100 scale, ""Faith and Flag Conservatives"" give him an average score of 83, with the ""Populist Right"" and ""Committed Conservatives"" ranking him in the 70s, and the ""Ambivalent Right"" putting him at just 43 -- barely higher than their opinion of President Joe Biden. Three-quarters or more of ""Faith and Flag Conservatives"" and the ""Populist Right"" say that the GOP should not be accepting of any criticism of Trump from elected officials, while a smaller 63% of ""Committed Conservatives"" and 40% of the ""Ambivalent Right"" say the same.The DemocratsThe Democratic Party's supporters largely align over economic issues and on the general need for a larger role for government. Fault lines in the Democratic Party emerge around ideological divides on how far that expanded government should go, particularly around policies to combat racism, on climate and on immigration. There are also splits on military policy and perceptions of the American role in the world, as well as in some respects by race and ethnicity, age and education. The largest of the four subsets of Democrats are:""Democratic Mainstays,"" (28% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents), a racially diverse, older core made up largely of self-identified Democrats. About 4 in 10 Black Democrats align with this category, the largest concentration of any racial or ethnic group within the Democratic coalition, and most in this group consider themselves moderate.To the ideological left of Democratic Mainstays are ""Establishment Liberals"" (23%), a diverse subset of the Democratic Party holding largely liberal views.A smaller, but highly active, slice of liberal Democrats make up the ""Progressive Left"" (12%). This younger, less diverse and more highly educated group of Democrats is more likely than others to consider themselves very liberal, to hold negative views of the Republican Party and to say that government services should be greatly expanded.Finally, the ""Outsider Left"" make up the youngest segment of the Democratic Party, and are roughly 16% of the Party's coalition. Besides its age, this group is marked by its dissatisfaction with government and the Democratic Party, despite holding broadly liberal ideological views. The strongest points of agreement within the Democratic coalition are:A unified view that the economy is tilted toward the powerful. More than 8 in 10 in each Democratic subgroup agrees that the economic system in the country unfairly favors the powerful. Nearly all want to see tax rates increased for large business and corporations, and there is widespread support across groups for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. An overarching belief that government needs to do more to solve problems. At least three-quarters in each subset of the Democratic Party says government should be doing more to solve problems -- that peaks at 98% for the ""Progressive Left.""Broad agreement that a lot needs to be done to ensure equal rights across racial and ethnic lines. Roughly three-quarters or more in each of the Democratic subsets agree that there is a lot more to be done to make sure that all Americans have equal rights, and majorities across Democratic subsets say that White people benefit a great deal from advantages that Black people do not have. And the critical dividing lines for Democrats are:How much government should do to solve problems. Although Democrats broadly agree that more government action is needed, they differ on the extent of that effort. While 63% of the ""Progressive Left"" say government services should be greatly expanded, that drops to roughly a third in the other Democratic subsets. How to address racial inequality. Democrats differ over whether achieving greater equality requires a complete rebuild of US laws and major institutions. While 71% of ""Progressive Left"" Democrats say a total overhaul is needed, that drops to just 29% among ""Establishment Liberals.""Where they stand on issues of crime and justice. There's a nearly 40-point swing between ""Democratic Mainstays"" (11%) and ""Progressive Left"" (48%) over whether spending on policing ought to be decreased. And about three-quarters of ""Democratic Mainstays"" say that violent crime is a very big national problem, compared with roughly a quarter among ""Progressive Left.""How far government ought to go to fight climate change. While most across Democratic groups agree that climate change is a big problem, and generally say environmental regulations are worth the cost, they split over whether the US ought to move entirely to renewable energy sources. Just 42% of ""Democratic Mainstays"" say the US should phase out oil, coal and natural gas vs. majorities in the ""Outsider Left"" and ""Progressive Left.""How satisfied they are with their party. While a majority of ""Democratic Mainstays"" and ""Establishment Liberals"" say that the Democratic Party makes them proud, less than half of the ""Progressive Left"" and fewer than a quarter of the ""Outsider Left"" agree. Within the ""Outsider Left"" in particular, only about half say the Democratic Party represents them well, compared with 8 in 10 or more among other subsets. The Pew Research Center based its typology primarily on a survey of 10,221 US adults reached through a nationally representative online panel on July 8-18, 2021, with a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points for the full sample. Data from additional surveys of some respondents were also included. Responses to the survey were used to classify the public into a set of nine groups based on their answers to 27 questions about social and political values.

119,Bill Nye teams up with White House to highlight how Biden's economic agenda will help combat climate crisis,"Bill Nye will come to the White House on Tuesday to help President Joe Biden promote his economic agenda and highlight how it will help combat the climate crisis, a White House official tells CNN. Nye -- better known as ""Bill Nye, the Science Guy"" -- will film a video with the President to highlight the effect of both the bipartisan infrastructure bill as well as the larger climate and economic package to tackle the climate crisis and create jobs, the official said. The video will be ""short-form digital piece,"" and will be posted on Nye's TikTok and Instagram accounts, which have a combined following of more than 11 million people.The video with Nye comes as the White House is sellling the bipartisan infrastructure package to the American public. Biden will travel to Baltimore on Wednesday to tout its benefits, the first stop on what's expected to be a traveling tour after the House of Representatives passed the piece of legislation last week. Nye has long been raising the alarm about the climate crisis and its effects on the planet. Earlier this year, Nye testified before Congress about the impacts of climate change and argued it was time for the government to ""invest in a big way"" to curb its effects. His television program ""Bill Nye the Science Guy"" has helped educate children on a wide range of scientific topics. Biden is expected to sign the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law ""very soon,"" White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday, but is waiting until Congress is back in session and members are in Washington so they can attend. It will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, touching everything from bridges and roads to the nation's broadband, water and energy systems.The second part of Biden's economic agenda -- the massive package to expand the social safety net and combat the climate crisis -- remains a work in progress. On Monday, Biden expressed optimism that Congress would pass the legislation but noted it would likely be ""a tough fight"" to get it across the finish line.If passed, it would be the largest legislative investment on climate in US history. White House officials say it will cut a billion metric tons of US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The White House is also confident it would put the US track to meet Biden's Paris Agreement goal: a 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. At the same time, activists at the United Nations Climate Summit in Glasgow have castigated the US and other rich nations for not doing more to combat climate change and have remained pessimistic about the chances the world can hit the goals set in the Paris climate agreementDemocrats are still negotiating the final details of the larger climate and economic package. It focuses on care for families, addressing the climate crisis, expanding access to health care, lowering costs for the middle class and tax reforms.The bill would deliver nearly $570 billion in tax credits and investments aimed at combating climate change. It would offer tax credits to families that install solar rooftops or buy electric vehicles, for example. The investments are aimed at providing incentives to grow domestic supply chains in solar and wind industries.The legislation also calls for creating 300,000 jobs by establishing a Civilian Climate Corps that works to conserve public lands and bolster community resiliency.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211109105648-bill-nye-file-2015-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/bill-nye-white-house-biden/index.html,2021-11-09T16:53.000Z,80.0,politics
120,Part of DC lawsuit against Trump's inaugural committee moves toward trial,"A lawsuit filed by DC Attorney General Karl Racine accusing former President Donald Trump's 2017 Presidential Inaugural Committee of abusing non-profit funds will proceed to trial after a DC Superior Court judge ruled Monday that claims accusing the committee of overpaying for event space may move forward. But Judge Jose Lopez dismissed the Trump Organization as a defendant and ruled that claims of waste and misuse of funds against the inaugural committee could not proceed.In a statement Monday night, a spokesperson for the attorney general said, ""Our lawsuit is moving forward and going to trial. The Inaugural Committee misspent more than $1 million in nonprofit funds to unlawfully benefit private interests. We cannot allow those in power to get away with using money to illegally enrich themselves and their families.""In addition, an official with the DC Attorney General's Office told CNN that now that the lawsuit will move to trial, they will renew their efforts to depose Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and other executives at the company. Weisselberg was indicted over the summer on tax fraud charges by the Manhattan district attorney's office. He pleaded not guilty.CNN has reached out to the inaugural committee and the Trump Organization, which still manages the Trump International Hotel in Washington, for comment.Racine filed the lawsuit in January 2020, accusing the inaugural committee of coordinating with the former President's family to ""grossly overpay"" for event space for inauguration events in January 2017 at the Trump International Hotel in DC. The lawsuit accused the inaugural committee of wasting about $1 million in charitable funds to pay for the event space at the hotel.In allowing the lawsuit to move forward only on the issue of whether the committee had overpaid for event space at the Trump International Hotel, Lopez found that there were genuine issues of fact that needed to be resolved.""Did higher ranking Trump family officials have the ability to control the workings of the PIC [Presidential Inaugural Committee],"" Lopez wrote. ""Did members of the PIC ignore internal recommendations to pay the Trump Hotel for services that could have been offered for free? If so, did they make those payments for strategic reasons, or for other purposes?""The attorney general's office says DC's non-profit laws state that funds must be used only for their stated public purpose and not for private interests. Racine has alleged that the inaugural committee was aware that it was paying far above market rates and never considered less expensive alternatives. He has also alleged that the inaugural committee paid for space on days it did not hold events.Lopez dismissed the attorney general's claims of waste because of the high legal bar Racine needed to clear: He needed to show that the inaugural committee had intentionally wasted its money ""so far beyond the bounds of reasonable business judgment that its only explanation was bad faith,"" according to Lopez. The judge ruled that the evidence did not satisfy that heavy burden.The lawsuit is seeking to recover more than $1 million that the DC attorney general says improperly benefited the Trump family, and it is asking the court to direct the recovered funds to another non-profit that is engaged in civic-focused charitable work.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211108215754-karl-racine-file-2019-restricted-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/trump-inaugural-committee-lawsuit-washington/index.html,2021-11-09T03:53.000Z,80.0,politics
127,Biden administration will waive immigration application fees for thousands of evacuated Afghans ,"The Biden administration is planning to waive immigration-related fees for up to 70,000 Afghan evacuees as they are resettled in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said Monday.The resettlement challenge has dogged the administration since the frenzied evacuation from Afghanistan in August: resettling tens of thousands of people -- many of whom worked with or on behalf of the US -- within only weeks or months.  The administration will now exempt Afghan evacuees -- many of whom arrived in the United States with little to nothing -- from paying costly application fees to get authorization to work or apply for lawful permanent residence.The filing fee for work permit applications -- which Afghans need to legally work in the US -- is $410 and fees for obtaining lawful permanent residence can be up to $1,225.""By providing these evacuees with access to streamlined processing and fee exemptions, we will open doors of opportunity for our Afghan allies and help them begin to rebuild their lives in communities across our country more quickly,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. ""Today's announcement provides some much needed financial relief to our newest Afghan neighbors,"" tweeted Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, the president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. ""Most of the families we're serving have no nest egg to draw from, and every expense is a source of stress and anxiety."" Afghans who were paroled into the US on or after July 30 are eligible for the fee exemptions, according to DHS.Last month, a group of Democratic senators urged DHS and US Citizenship and Immigration Services to waive fees for Afghans applying for humanitarian parole to come to the US, arguing the ""burden of application fees is weighing heavily on communities here in the United States.""According to DHS, there are approximately 51,000 people at eight Department of Defense sites in the US and roughly 2,500 at sites in Europe and the Middle East.A total of 68,000 Afghans have come to the US since August 17 -- shortly before the US military withdrawal from their country at the end of that month. More than 14,000 of them have been resettled in the US, per DHS.This story has been updated with reaction Monday.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181102165132-dhs-logo-file-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/dhs-afghan-fees-waived/index.html,2021-11-09T00:58.000Z,80.0,politics

""It's common sense ... If OSHA can tell people to wear a hard hat on the job, to be careful around chemicals, it can put in place these simple measures to keep our workers safe.""In the brief order, a three-judge panel on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said that the petitioners in the case -- Republican-led states and private businesses -- ""give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate,"" giving the federal government until 5 p.m., Monday to respond.On Sunday, Klain predicted that the case will be ""well litigated,"" before January 4 when the Biden administration announced the rule will take effect.""I'm not sure it really has much practical effect in the short run,"" Klain said, pointing to the numerous cases already brought against vaccine requirements.""These vaccine requirements have been litigated up and down the courts all over the country. State requirements for example, one in Maine. And every single court before this one ruled that they were valid,"" he added.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211103170531-moderna-vaccine-syringe-0212-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/politics/biden-vaccine-mandate-private-business/index.html,2021-11-07T15:48.000Z,80.0,politics
129,First person of color confirmed as permanent Census Bureau director,"The Senate voted on Thursday to confirm Robert Santos as director of the Census Bureau, making him the first person of color to hold the position in a permanent capacity. Santos, who is Mexican American, was confirmed in a 58-35 vote. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in voting to confirm him. Santos ""is an expert in survey sampling, survey design and more generally in social science/policy research, with over 40 years of experience,"" the White House said in a statement at the time of his nomination. He currently serves as vice president and chief methodologist at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization.President Joe Biden's selection of Santos had followed a turbulent year at the Census Bureau after the coronavirus pandemic hit just as the massive once-a-decade effort to count the US population was getting underway and scrambled the agency's plans.The census, which happens every 10 years, determines how many representatives each state gets in Congress, and how billions of dollars in federal funding is spent. Schools, roads and other important things in your community will gain -- or lose -- funding over the next 10 years depending on this official population tally. The most recent count was mired in political controversy following the Trump administration's drive to compile citizenship data and use it to the benefit of Republicans in an effort experts called unprecedented. Former President Donald Trump had specifically attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted when seats in Congress are divvied up between the states.Biden issued an executive order on his first day in office requiring non-citizens to be included in the Census and apportionment of congressional representatives. He rescinded the Trump-era policy saying that it ""conflicted with the principle of equal representation enshrined in our Constitution, census statutes, and historical tradition.""California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, the son of a cook and house cleaner who immigrated from Mexico, tweeted about the confirmation, saying in part, ""Great news! We just confirmed Robert Santos as Director of the Census Bureau—the first Latino to hold the position permanently. An accurate census is critical to our democracy & economy.""Santos' term is set to last five years and expire on December 31, 2026.CNN's Paul Leblanc contributed to this report.

134,Biden says his plans are working after October jobs report beats expectations,"President Joe Biden touted the progress the US is making in recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, and cited his policies as the reason, after the jobs recovery gathered some steam last month and employers added 531,000 positions in October. ""America is getting back to work. Our economy is starting to work for more Americans,"" Biden said, speaking from the White House. The better-than-expected report marked a possible turning point after two months of sluggish job gains that were chalked up to the Delta variant of Covid-19 spreading throughout the nation. The unemployment rate in October also fell to 4.6%, which is the lowest level since the economic recovery started in May 2020.It was very welcome news for the President and Democrats, who are still reeling from a gubernatorial defeat in Virginia and a closer-than-expected race in New Jersey this week. The political shocks raised serious concerns for Democrats over how their party would fare in the 2022 midterm elections and how Biden's presidency is being assessed by voters. ""This did not happen by accident or 'just because,' "" Biden said, pointing to the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill he signed into law earlier this year. ""We laid the foundation for this recovery with my American Rescue Plan that Congress passed at the beginning of my term. It put money in working families' pockets, it gave families with kids a tax cut each month, it helped keep small businesses going in the dark days earlier this year and it provided the resources to launch one of the fastest mass vaccination programs ever.""Biden -- whose approval rating last month hit the lowest level of his administration -- on Friday seized the opportunity to make the case his administration's response to the pandemic has been working. In particular, the jobs numbers helped boster the President's argument that vaccine mandates will help with the economic recovery. Biden's new vaccine mandate for businesses with 100 or more employees is being fought by Republican leaders throughout the country. There are currently 24 states that have sued or have formally threatened to sue the Biden administration over the mandate. ""Beating Covid-19 remains one of the most important ways to strengthen our economy -- not just save lives, but strengthen our economy. We're making progress,"" the President said.""That's good for our health, but it's also good for our economy,"" he added. ""Now vaccinated workers are going back to work. Vaccinated shoppers are going back to stores. And with the launch of the vaccine for kids ages 5 through 11 this week, we can make sure more vaccinated children can stay in school.""Biden also referenced the new Pfizer experimental pill to treat Covid-19 infections. An interim analysis -- done before the trial was scheduled to end -- showed an 89% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19 if given the drug within the first three days of symptom onset, Pfizer said earlier Friday.Still, the President said ""there's a lot more to be done.""""We still have to tackle the costs that American families are facing, but this recovery is faster, stronger, and fair and wider than almost anyone could have predicted,"" Biden said. The President said he wants to make sure the recovery ""is fully felt,"" and that Americans see the progress ""in their lives, bank accounts, in their hopes and expectations, for tomorrow is better than today.""The President ramped up the pressure on Capitol Hill and called on the House to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the massive climate and social safety net bill immediately.

152,Vin Diesel pleads with Dwayne Johnson to return for 'Fast & Furious 10',"Vin Diesel is calling on Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to end their highly publicized feud and re-join ""Fast & Furious"" for the franchise finale. The 54-year-old actor, who plays Dominic Toretto in the movies, extended an olive branch on Sunday by sharing an open letter on Instagram directed at his former co-star. ""My little brother Dwayne... the time has come,"" he wrote alongside a picture of the pair facing each other. ""The world awaits the finale of Fast 10.""  Diesel went on to say his children still refer to Johnson as ""Uncle Dwayne,"" despite their well-documented rift.  ""There is not a holiday that goes by that they and you don't send well wishes,"" he added.  Johnson, 49, made his debut as federal agent Luke Hobbs in 2011's  ""Fast Five"" and reprised his role for the sixth, seventh and eighth installments of the franchise before landing his own spin-off, ""Hobbs & Shaw."" The pair's feud erupted in 2016, during the final weeks of filming 2017's ""The Fate Of The Furious."" At the time, Johnson posted a photo on his verified Instagram account -- which he has since removed -- in which he slammed unnamed male co-stars. ""Some (male co-stars) conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't,"" Johnson wrote at the time. Diesel told Men's Health in June this year that as a producer for the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, ""tough love"" was at the root of his conflict with Johnson. ""It was a tough character to embody, the Hobbs character,"" he said. ""My approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be.""  However, Johnson pushed back in his recent cover story with Vanity Fair, saying he and Diesel were ""philosophically two different people"" who ""approach the business of moviemaking in two very different ways."" While Johnson told The Hollywood Reporter in July that he would not be returning for any more ""Fast & Furious"" movies, it looks like Diesel is ready to let bygones be bygones in order to fulfill his promise to the late Paul Walker (whom he refers to as ""Pablo"") to give the franchise a fitting end. Walker starred as Brian O'Conner in the franchise until his death in 2013.""I swore that we would reach and manifest the best Fast in the finale that is 10,"" he continued, in his message to Johnson. ""I say this out of love... but you must show up, do not leave the franchise idle you have a very important role to play. Hobbs can't be played by no other. I hope that you rise to the occasion and fulfill your destiny."" CNN has contacted Johnson's representatives for comment.

153,Alec Baldwin says productions should hire police officers to 'monitor weapons safety',"Alec Baldwin thinks police officers could be best suited to help film and television productions monitor the safe use of weapons on sets. ""Every film/TV set that uses guns, fake or otherwise, should have a police officer on set, hired by the production, to specifically monitor weapons safety,"" Baldwin tweeted on Monday, his latest statement regarding on-set safety in the wake of the fatal shooting on the set of his film ""Rust.""A source close to the actor told CNN that Baldwin remains cooperative with requests from authorities and will ""do whatever is asked"" as the investigation continues. Baldwin and his family are expected to remain in Vermont for the foreseeable future as they deal with the aftermath of last month's tragedy, the source added.Director of photography Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza injured last month after Baldwin discharged a weapon during a rehearsal that contained what authorities suspect was a live round.The incident, which remains under investigation, has renewed calls for better safety practices on sets with regards to the use of weapons. Some individual productions have banned the use of real guns on set and mandated the use of alternate options. ABC's ""The Rookie,"" for example, set a new policy to mandate the use of airsoft guns, which are replica guns with reduced power that typically fire plastic pellets. Dwayne Johnson has also said there will be no real guns used on his movie sets going forward.Weapons expert Ben Simmons previously explained to CNN that typically three types of prop guns are used on set -- completely fake firearms (that looks real but can't fire anything), deactivated firearms and real firearms, which are loaded with blanks and mimic actual shooting, from flash to recoil.Authorities continue to investigate the moments leading up to the shooting, including the weapon chain of command and how the gun used by Baldwin became loaded with a suspected live round.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211101182206-rba-baldwin-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/08/entertainment/alec-baldwin/index.html,2021-11-08T17:58.000Z,80.0,entertainment
155,Monday morning movie wrap party: 'Eternals' ,"""Eternals"" have landed, and we must have a discussion. First and most obvious, a question you've been pondering since you left the theater: How would I rank this among other Marvel movies? Well, friends, I don't like hate mail. So I'm not doing that. But I did place it on this Marvel movie matrix to help you understand our feelings. ""Eternals"" is meant to be an introduction to a new phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but unlike some of the other first films we've seen from Marvel (see: ""Iron Man""), you would benefit from having some base knowledge before heading into this movie. (There's references to the Blip, for example.) Tonally, ""Eternals"" does not have the pure fun factor of a ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" so I'd measure expectations of that accordingly if anyone who hasn't seen it yet plans to do so this week. And if you fall into that camp, stop reading after the graphic, because spoilers are ahead: This is where we acknowledge that every topic of the Marvel kind is highly subjective. So you're welcome to disagree on any of these placements. While you ponder your feelings, here's some more ""Eternals"" buzz: MVE (most valuable Eternal)So many Eternals, so little time. It's hard to say which Eternal really stole the show in this film, but I'd give my MVE status to two characters, Brian Tyree Henry's Phastos and Don Lee's Gilgamesh. The latter provided the most emotional capital in the movie, playing the psycho-taming Yin to Thena's (Angelina Jolie) Yang. Like her, I have a soft spot for a man with super strength who shatters toxic masculinity with a tender, caring heart and pie making. RIP. Phastos, meanwhile, was the literal brains of this operation. If we're talking pure abilities, Phastos was a vital cog in the Eternals machine, in addition to being a pretty wonderful dad, it seems. Bravo to Marvel for breaking down barriers with its first LGBTQ+ hero and its first deaf superhero in the lovely but underserved Makkari. But count me on Team Phastos. $$$Let's talk money: There are two schools of thought on the $71 million box office debut from ""Eternals."" School 1: Wow. $71 million? Fourth-best debut of the year? Woohoo. School 2: Hmmm. Nice, but it's no ""Shang-Chi."" My take? The success of ""The Eternals"" can't be summed up in a weekend. The question that would be making me sweat if I worked at Marvel HQ is if ""Eternals 2"" was a movie right now, who would go see it? Was this the running start to a new phase of the MCU that Marvel needed? If you believe the lukewarm reviews, the answer is probably no. If you believe me, the answer is kinda. Ten new characters was just a lot to serve in one movie, so it was hard for me to get connected. CNN's Brian Lowry offered another thought in the Reliable Sources newsletter: ""Tea-leaf readers analyzing the slightly below-expectations opening weekend of Eternals have cited various factors, but here's another one to consider: With ""Shang Chi"" and now this latest expansion, the studio has rolled out two movies based on new characters, at a time when Disney+ has been presenting series based on familiar ones -- 'WandaVision,' 'The Falcon & the Winter Soldier,' 'Loki,' and the upcoming 'Hawkeye.' The two media can obviously coexist, but people have been getting their Marvel fix of late somewhere other than at the movies. Also, the next wave of Marvel titles are mostly sequels, which should come to battle with more of a built-in following than these films based on comics from the 1970s."" 7 very not important burning questionsI'm not going to ask about the meaning of the mid-credit sequence or the end credit sequence because, frankly, there are Marvel experts discussing that in other corners of the internet. Here are some lesser thoughts plaguing me: Why did the Celestial look like the Iron Giant? Did anyone else wonder if the use of the song ""The End of the World,"" played when Phastos is saying goodbye to his family, was a reference to another famous Angelina Jolie movie, ""Girl, Interrupted?"" (It's the same one used in the scene when Daisy is found hanging.) Maybe it was the different colored suits, but some of the scenes that featured all the heroes in one shot felt more ""Power Rangers"" than ""Avengers"" to me. Agree or disagree? How many people in your theater audibly said ""awww"" when Gilgamesh dropped his pie? Mine had at least 4, including myself. Is Angelina Jolie the Queen of On-Screen Crazy? I vote yes.Was anyone else super bummed that Kingo completely missed the big battle at the end? I kept waiting for him to come back or swoop in. Was this a budget or timing-related decision? Either way, if you're in a Marvel movie as an actor, I'd imagine you want to be in the big battle. Justice for Kumail! Harry Styles appeared in the mid-credit sequence as Thanos's brother Starfox. So does this mean BTS exists in the MCU but One Direction does not? If so, whoa.

157,What my uncle Neil Sedaka taught me about the evolution of hit making,"A few months ago, I was listening to the radio in the car with my buddy Noam. He said to me, ""Your uncle is far more respected in the music industry than [this artist]."" My uncle is Neil Sedaka. I won't tell you who the other artist he mentioned was, but he's someone with many number one hits in the 1970s and has a nickname for his fans. My moment with Noam was game changing for me, even though have known for a long time that the man I know as Uncle Neil was famous. I can recall seeing gold and platinum records lining his apartment. There are photos of Uncle Neil with the guy with big sunglasses in his kitchen. Not to mention that I've been backstage at a few concerts.  Still, I hadn't realized how rare his success was, so I decided to talk with my Uncle Neil and look into how his career illustrates the overall arc of the changing music industry. You can listen to our conversation on this week's ""Margins of Error"" podcast.Some of the younger people reading this may not know who Uncle Neil is. You might confuse him with Neil Diamond or even Neil Young, but I bet most of you will have heard the phrases ""love will keep us together"" or ""breaking up is hard to do."" Those were both number one songs in this country, and Uncle Neil wrote the music for both of them. Uncle Neil is considered so timeless that he was asked to guest host on season two of ""American Idol"" in 2003. Soon after, contestant Clay Aiken charted with Uncle Neil's ""Solitaire"" making him one of a few artists to chart in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 five decades (1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 2000s). But what makes Uncle Neil so rare is that he both wrote and sung most of his top hits. He's one of only about 80 artists to have partially written and sung at least three No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100. And as the ""American Idol"" appearance hints at, Uncle Neil was able to transcend pop trends and reach success across wildly different musical eras. He's one only of about ten artists to have three No. 1 hits that he sung and wrote with more than a dozen years in-between his first and last No. 1 hit. You probably recognize some of the other names on that list like Madonna, Mariah Carey, Elton John and Janet Jackson. Indeed, Uncle Neil wasn't just about length, but about depth. From 1959-1963, he became the second best-selling artist next to Elvis Presley. Uncle Neil knew he was on top of the world when he saw his first number one hit (the aforementioned ""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do"") on the Billboard Hot 100. But the current music industry is very different. There are now more Billboard charts than we can count. In my Uncle's heyday, you listened to songs on a record or over the radio; there are so many options at our fingertips now.  All you need to do is press a piece of glass. According to Will Page, a former Chief Economist at Spotify, there are now over 75,000 songs a day being released via streaming and over 70 million songs available to us at any time because of streaming. These numbers are rapidly changing and are far different than back in the day. In the 1970s, at place like Tower Records, you'd have about 40,000 albums to choose from.The way we view success for today's artists are much more varied than they were 65 years ago when Uncle Neil was getting his start. Is a song a hit if it is trending on YouTube? What if it becomes associated with a Tik-Tok meme?  The idea of radio plays and selling songs just doesn't hold the same water as it used to. Put another way, they don't always reflect the wider cultural issues and conversations that are happening.If the Billboard Hot 100 was Uncle Neil's ""bible"" of success, what are the guideposts today? Are there any?You'll have to tune in to find out.

167,"TV OT: Is TLC the weirdest network on TV? Plus, revisiting the fall's 'Big Leap' into less-'Ordinary' series ","Welcome to November. Insert your screams here. Enjoy this week's TV OT: Is TLC the weirdest network on TV?Although I generally prefer to keep my blemishes covered under layers of well-blended concealer, there's a public pimple I must pop in the name of transparency: Over the years, I have watched a lot of TLC. I'm someone who generally believes there should be no such term when talking television as ""guilty pleasure"" because you should not be ashamed of what brings you comfort. But I can't say that watching ""Sister Wives"" (returning Nov. 21) or ""My 600 lb. Life"" (new season airing now) or ""So Freakin' Cheap"" brings me anything resembling pleasure, but I can't stop. In that lies the mystery of what I'll now controversially say is television's weirdest and most fascinating network. Unlike streaming networks, which can bury their junk and still win awards for its prestige content or broadcast networks that have to worry deeply about offending any of their increasingly fewer viewers, TLC lives in their crud. Heck, they often celebrate it. (For the sake of this discussion, I'll make one quick point: I won't get into the network's utter failings in the handling of anything relating to the Duggars, but it is part of why I struggle with watching TLC period.)This is where I should point out that like any network, TLC has some range. For example, it has given a home to the inspiring story of transgender teen Jazz Jennings. ""I Am Jazz,"" entering its seventh season this month, has done volumes for bringing awareness to the challenges of being young and trans -- something that is arguably (and sadly) more needed now than when it premiered. The baffling part of TLC is that its spectrum has such an applaudable high and multiple in-the-bowels-of-television lows, of which I won't dare to pick the most objectionable. Though, if it was still on the air, it'd be the show where I once watched the story of a man who was in an intimate relationship with his car.  I know I'm not alone in watching any of it, though. TLC's ""90 Day Fiancé,"" franchise is a crazy success. (But one friend who used to watch it told me she stopped because the two-hour episodes and constant spin-offs was too much to keep up with) In a time when networks have a small stable of reliable performers, TLC has multiple shows that have been on for 6-plus seasons. (""Little People, Big World"" wrapped up Season 22 earlier this year.) And one of its newer shows, ""Dr. Pimple Popper,"" is so popular, it's getting a Christmas Special — subtitled ""A Pimple Carol."" ""It's unlike any other programming on TV right now,"" says one friend, who spoke on a condition of anonymity and we all understand why. ""It's against social norms. We don't have a lot of drama in our lives, but we watch it on TV."" This one half of a married couple says they've watched everything from ""90 Day Fiancé"" to ""Extreme Sisters,"" a series that explored sisters whose close bonds veer into baffling territory.  The other half of the couple adds: ""It's a world you just don't know. You get sucked in.""  And maybe that the secret? TLC is the television equivalent of a highway car crash that you can't look away from. The loudest objection I hear to TLC programming is that it can feel exploitative and often mean in spirit. But I'd argue we are all accountable for our own reactions to the stories we see in the same way the participants are accountable for agreeing to be featured. Do I judge weird couples? Yes. But do I also cry watching ""My 600 Lb. Life""? Absolutely. And did everyone featured on any of these shows knowingly sign up to be on TV? Definitely. TLC hasn't been The Learning Channel for a long time, to the disappointment of many. But they've found success, perhaps, in deciding that there was an audience for Television that Loathes the Conventional.  Revisiting the fall's 'Big Leap' into less-'Ordinary' seriesNow, tossing it over to Brian Lowry with a mid-fall TV update. ""One of the problems reviewing series that have slightly more ambition than 'FBI' spinoffs is the question of whether a frontloaded couple of episodes can actually be sustained over the course of a season, much less multiple seasons.Happily, three network shows that earned the most favorable reactions when they made their debuts this fall -- ""The Big Leap,"" ""Ordinary Joe"" and 'Ghosts' -- continue to hold up quite well.Fox's 'Big Leap' might be the most impressive of the bunch, finding clever layers as it combines the characters -- participating in a fictitious reality-TV dance show -- in unexpected ways. It's consistently sweet, funny and fairly smart about how the reality sausage gets made, with Scott Foley shining as the amoral producer who'll step over pretty much anyone in pursuit of a second-season renewal.NBC's 'Ordinary Joe,' meanwhile, has built on its pilot with details about the central character, played by James Wolk, following him on three separate paths diverted by one decision he made at a crucial point in his life. A little strained at times, it remains a feat of editing and has steadily dropped new tidbits to expand the story.Finally, 'Ghosts' has stood out as a non-cookie-cutter comedy for CBS, with a couple moving into a house inhabited by ghosts from different eras. Although it has the benefit of being adapted from a British show, that's no guarantee of durability on a more expansive US TV schedule, which the show has thus far exhibited.All told, it's an encouraging sign for the major networks, which at times have appeared willing to ride their existing franchises ('Chicago' everything, 'Law & Order,' etc.) into a steady march toward oblivion.These new shows suggest there's life in the model, especially if you'll take a few creative risks to expand it.""'Class' dismissedFor your weekend watch list, here's Lowry again with a recommendation. ""OK, we get it, established intellectual property is all the rage, but the new 'Head of the Class' revival, on HBO Max (like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia), feels more peripherally tethered to the mildly memorable show that preceded it than most.Here, Isabella Gomez (a veteran of the 'One Day at a Time' revival) plays the slacker teacher to a group of high-achieving kids, in a series that feels as generic as that sounds. Despite the fresh faces, there's little to distinguish this from a network sitcom in the 1980s.As for connections to the original, Robin Givens shows up in a subsequent episode, which is nice.In terms of making us look with the title, mission accomplished. Making us stick around is another matter.""A 'Symbol'-ic gestureAnd another from Lowry: a programming note for the Peacock-less.""NBC developed 'The Lost Symbol,' based on Dan Brown's Robert Langdon character, for the network, then decided to premiere the series on its streaming service, Peacock. Now the show is getting a one-time showing on NBC in place of an 'Ordinary Joe' repeat.It's a small thing, but the synergistic move is another example of the juggling act that studios face as they consider where their shows will fare the best. Frankly, 'Lost Symbol' might have been a long shot in any venue, but like 'Head of the Class,' it probably would have looked more at home on a broadcast network in the first place.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211105134628-90-day-fiance-tlc-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/entertainment/what-to-watch-tlc-big-leap/index.html,2021-11-05T21:13.000Z,80.0,entertainment

169,"Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot go for the green in 'Red Notice'","""Red Notice"" has the polished feel of something concocted in a lab for maximum social-media attention (Dwayne Johnson! Ryan Reynolds! Gal Gadot!), then pieced together Frankenstein-style from parts of other movies. Yet the net effect is mildly enjoyable, creating a throwback caper film that showcases its stars doing what they do best, or rather for which they're best known.Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who teamed with Johnson, whose company produced the film, on ""Central Intelligence"" and ""Skyscraper""), ""Red Notice""borrows unabashedly from other films but doesn't appear the least bit red-faced or apologetic about it. There's the mismatched cop-thief pairing from ""48 Hrs.,"" the party sequence from ""True Lies,"" the clue-solving from ""National Treasure,"" and so on.Any movie that jokes about the sought-after loot being a MacGuffin, a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's name for whatever priceless artifact set his plots in motion, or has Reynolds whistle the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" march clearly isn't taking itself too seriously.Again, though, it generally works, with Johnson as Agent John Hartley, an FBI profiler (a little bulky for that gig, as is pointed out) on the trail of Reynolds' Nolan Booth, a master thief searching for three gold-plated eggs of immeasurable value given to Cleopatra.Their relationship is complicated by another thief, Gadot's The Bishop -- like Booth, given a ""red notice,"" or ""most wanted"" tag, by the international agency Interpol -- who invariably seems to be one step ahead of both of them, forcing the two to grudgingly team up.Globetrotting hijinks ensue, with scads of action and fighting but little in the way of blood or bodies, keeping things relatively light and, a few naughty words and sexual references aside, family friendly.Nobody can be accused of stretching their creative portfolio here, with Reynolds tossing off one smart-alecky one-liner after another (mostly at Johnson's expense), Johnson portraying a square-jawed hero and Gadot proving mysterious, alluring and characteristically wonder-ful. (When she turns up in a slinky red dress, Reynolds dryly tells her she looks OK.)Like Reynolds' earlier film for the service ""6 Underground,"" it's the sort of big, muscular action vehicle that certainly wouldn't look out of place in theaters, buttressing Netflix's desire to offer a little something for everyone with an off-the-charts ""You might like"" factor to feed the service's algorithms.Indeed, having this movie arrive heading into the service's twin onslaught of holiday fare and award contenders almost plays like a calculated alternative, cheerfully free of any pretensions about high art. Let other movies fret about taking home gold. Like its thieves, ""Red Notice"" is transparently committed to going for the green.""Red Notice"" premieres in select theaters on Nov. 5 and Nov. 12 on Netflix.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211103172855-02-red-notice-netflix-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/entertainment/red-notice-review/index.html,2021-11-05T13:29.000Z,80.0,entertainment
170,"Tom Hanks is alone again in 'Finch,' with only a dog and robot for company","Apple TV+ must really like Tom Hanks, with ""Finch"" representing the second movie featuring the actor the service scooped up during the pandemic. Like ""Greyhound,"" this one is in a modest affair that would likely have been hard-pressed to make waves in theaters, casting Hanks in a last-man-on-Earth scenario that's part ""Cast Away,"" part ""WALL-E.""Indeed, although production wrapped before the pandemic, the premise -- which casts Hanks as the title character, a robotics engineer by training, who survives an apocalypse (eventually explained) with only his dog and a newly operative robot -- would have been ideal for shooting under Covid protocols with such a limited cast.The robot (performed Caleb Landry Jones) takes the name Jeff, and like a number of recent projects, ""Finch"" winds up being an exploration not only of the man's fight for survival but the machine's dawning humanity, with Finch programming it to make caring for the dog, should anything happen to him, its prime directive.Most of the movie focuses on Finch and his companions struggling against the elements, forced to flee by unpredictable weather and massive storms while searching for places that ""haven't been ransacked or looted.""Along the way, Finch teaches Jeff how to drive (the robot insists he's ""an excellent driver,"" inviting a ""Rain Man"" reference), tells stories that offer a modest window into his past and searches for canned food for man and beast.Director Miguel Sapochnik (""Game of Thrones"") does what he can to wring the maximum amount of emotion out of this unlikely trio, finding moments of tenderness and humor in their interactions. The on-the-road format also owes something to another recent Hanks movie, ""News of the World,"" traveling there by wagon instead of RV.Yet even with Hank's innate likability that feels like a limited template, making this one of those road movies that proceeds at a decent pace but doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. Moreover, the underlying scenario is so bleak as to somewhat offset the lighter elements, despite the very good boy and robot that accompany him.Studios have been fairly shrewd about which movies to hold until theatrical release became possible and which to sell to streaming services hungry for programming, especially with someone like Hanks to help promote it.""Finch"" is practically a poster child for that latter category, the kind of film that delivers a bigger pop as an entry on Apple TV+'s playlist than it does on your screen.""Finch"" premieres Nov. 5 on Apple TV+.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211102171935-finch-review-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/04/entertainment/finch-review/index.html,2021-11-04T12:44.000Z,80.0,entertainment
172,'Spencer' shows off Kristen Stewart in a 'fable' about Diana's break from the Royals,"Kristen Stewart's fierce, attention-grabbing work as Princess Diana really ought to be viewed independently of ""Spencer,"" described as ""a fable from a true tragedy"" that presents a pivotal weekend in Princess Diana's split from the Royal Family. That is, it's possible to admire the performance and still come away feeling director Pablo Larrain's fictionalized movie doesn't significantly add to a story many of us already know in exhaustive detail.Larrain, notably, offered a similar take on American royalty with ""Jackie,"" which starred Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy. In what is becoming his anthology of famous women facing crises, he has created another strong showcase for the star while crafting a movie that's a little too precious for its own good.""Spencer"" (Diana's surname, for any who have forgotten) takes off in speculative ways based on a real moment, when Diana spent Christmas weekend with the Royals at the Queen's Sandringham Estate as her marriage to Prince Charles (Jack Farthing) was crumbling. Arriving late, she's alternately depressed and defiant, well aware that all eyes are on her even before being warned that the press is ""circling us.""The dissonant music thus becomes a proxy for what's going on inside Diana's head (some of her long walks down the hall bring to mind ""The Shining""), as she reads a book about the ill-fated Anne Boleyn and wonders whether she could wind up on the chopping block. She also is dealing with bulimia, to the point where the chef worries about her meals and Charles asks her not to purge them. Diana's rebelliousness catches the eye of a starched bureaucrat (Timothy Spall) who is there to keep an eye on her and mitigate potential harm to the family. The most sympathetic presence, meanwhile, is Diana's dresser (Sally Hawkins), who doesn't bat an eye when Diana tells her an outfit ""doesn't fit my mood,"" and assesses her position vis-à-vis the Royal Family by saying, ""They can't change. You have to change.""Ultimately, ""Spencer"" seeks to be an ennobling account of Diana's ordeal, capturing her at a moment of profound unhappiness, where she appears to face a stark choice between breaking down or breaking free.Yet while Stewart puts her stamp on the character, the license that comes from labeling this a fable makes the movie play less like an attempt to get to the truth behind that turmoil than an indulgence with the misfortune of following an entire season devoted to it on ""The Crown,"" and less successfully the Netflix presentation ""Diana: The Musical.""Obviously, the enduring fascination with the Royals and those uneasily wearing crowns in general, and Diana in particular, makes this fertile territory -- the circling never stopped -- but once you get past how Stewart captures Diana's look and spirit, there's not much more to see or learn.In the same way the carefully orchestrated pictures and magazine covers created a veneer that often belied Diana's reality, ""Spencer"" is a case where the coming attractions essentially contain everything you need to know about the movie.""Spencer"" premieres Nov. 5 in US theaters. It's rated R.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211101183140-spencer-review-restricted-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/03/entertainment/spencer-review/index.html,2021-11-03T13:17.000Z,80.0,entertainment
173,Who are the Eternals? Get to know the Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest heroes,"In the last year, Marvel introduced viewers to Agatha Harkness and Monica Rambeau, Sylvie and Mobius, Yelena, Shang-Chi and a new Captain America, to name a few. Phew. Brace yourselves, fatigued fans, because the Marvel Cinematic Universe is adding at least 10 more new superheroes and villains this month in ""Eternals,"" the new film by Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao. You'll have a bit over a month to commit their names and stories to memory before Marvel unloads ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" onto audiences (and a few weeks after that, yet another hero is getting their own Disney+ show -- rest while you can).Lucky for you, we've created an ""Eternals"" cheat sheet of sorts so diehard and casual fans alike can keep things straight. Here's what you need to know about the Eternals before the film's release on November 5. (This writer has not seen the film yet, but light spoilers from the comics follow.) So ... who/what are the Eternals?The Eternals are not quite people, not quite gods (though humans often mistake them for gods, which annoys the space deities who created them and the Greek gods for which a few of the Eternals are named). Though they each have unique powers, they're all skilled warriors with super-strength, speed and agility. The heroes are mostly immortal -- even if their bodies are destroyed, they can live on in other ways. But they keep their powers secret since they live among humans. They were sent to Earth by the Celestials, an ancient group of godlike beings, some 7,000 years before the events of the film to defend humankind against the Deviants, mutant monsters also created by the Celestials when some tests on early Earth-dwellers went awry. The Eternals are advised against interfering in non-Deviant business, instead acting as mere spectators to human conflict unless Deviants are involved. While the Eternals have obeyed the Celestials until now, they're finally starting to question their mission and the beings who created them. Like most protagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe who have gotten their own origin stories, the Eternals probably don't fancy themselves superheroes. But by the film's end, after they've undergone various transformations and vanquish various foes, they'll likely be among the most powerful heroes in the MCU, and maybe, the MCM -- the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse. Meet Marvel's 10 EternalsIkarisPlayed by: Richard MaddenIn the comics, the Eternals are often led by Ikaris, usually portrayed as a blond-haired, blue-eyed muscleman reminiscent of He-Man but with laser eyes. In some comics appearances, he's been named the Prime Eternal, or the Eternal who rules over the rest. Powers: Laser-beam eyes. You name it, Ikaris can probably do it. He can fly at speeds up to 850 miles per hour, creates convincing illusions and shoots laser beams out of his eyes, among many other abilities. Who knew? In the comics, when he's in disguise as a human, he goes by the name ""Ike Harris."" Ikaris is definitely one of the brawniest Eternals, but creative, he is not. SersiPlayed by: Gemma ChanIf it's Ikaris who typically runs the Eternals in the comics sphere, Sersi is its heart. She's something of a historian of humankind, having had a first-row seat to events like the fall of Rome and the French Revolution, per Marvel. You'll often find Sersi in green, a nod, perhaps, to her deep love and appreciation of the Earth and its inhabitants. She's also had a centuries-long, on-and-off relationship with fellow Eternal, Ikaris. Powers: Matter transmutation. Basically, she can alter matter into any form she chooses (remember in the ""Eternals"" trailer, when she appears to dissolve a double decker bus into a parade of petals?). Who knew? In the comics, Sersi joined the Avengers for a spell. Though she later quit the group full-time, she sometimes still helps them out when they need a hand from a godlike hero.SpritePlayed by: Lia McHughSprite is as mischievous as her name suggests. Though she's just as old as her counterparts, she has the appearance of a perpetual preteen, which she uses to her advantage -- one comics run saw her starring in her own teen sitcom. Her naivety can also be disastrous, though: In one series, the Sprite ""altered reality on a cosmic scale,"" according to Marvel. Sprite has also been written as male in the comics for much of the character's run. Powers: Illusions. The group's ""grandiose storyteller,"" Sprite casts lifelike mirages and can teleport herself if needed. Who knew? She was once, according to Marvel, a thorn in the side of William Shakespeare, inspiring the Bard's character ""Puck"" in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""PhastosPlayed by: Brian Tyree HenryThe inventor of the group and a sworn pacifist, Phastos is also the first out, gay superhero in the MCU. (While Marvel comics feature a number of queer characters, only a few other characters -- including Valkyrie and Loki -- have been suggested, though not confirmed, to be queer onscreen.) Based on the film's trailers, he's also a frugal home decorator with a penchant for Ikea and sarcasm. Powers: Invention and ""technopathy."" If Phastos can see something in his mind's eye, he can make it real -- he has the ability to conjure up weapons and other inventions with little more than a thought. Who knew? At one point in the comics, he took the codename ""Ceasefire"" -- a nod to his stance against war. (No one tell him he's a superhero created to wage war against monsters!) ThenaPlayed by: Angelina JolieIt's no coincidence that Thena's name is so similar to that of the Greek goddess of war -- according to Marvel, Thena is ""more comfortable in battle than anywhere else."" Like Phastos, she can conjure weapons with her mind, though she takes pleasure in wielding them and unleashing cosmic, PG-13 carnage. Powers: Superhuman sparring. She's incredibly quick, strong, reflexive -- a nearly unbeatable warrior. Who knew? In the comics, she once had a dalliance with a Deviant leader named Kro, and their tumultuous relationship has hindered both the Eternals and their foes. AjakPlayed by: Salma HayekThough in the comics, Ajak is portrayed as male, Hayek said she sees her character as a maternal figure, a ""spiritual leader"" of sorts who connects with each of them even when they're at odds and keeps the group on course. Powers: Healing. Ajak heals both humans and Eternals, and she's one of the few to have direct contact with the Celestials to receive updates on their mission. Who knew? In the comics, Ajak is ""brilliant archaeologist and skilled wrestler,"" Marvel says. Even godlike heroes need hobbies.MakkariPlayed by: Lauren RidloffThe speed runner Makkari has dashed all around the planet and is, frankly, bored by what she's found. In the film, the Eternals ask her to put aside her boredom for a few days to help them defeat the Deviants and save the world so she can traverse other planets. Powers: Super speed. Quicksilver who? Makkari is the ""fastest woman in the universe,"" Marvel says. Who knew? Ridloff is deaf -- and Makkari is the first deaf superhero in the MCU -- so the Eternals communicate with Makkari via sign language. KingoPlayed by: Kumail Nanjiani While many of the other Eternals elected to live anonymously among humankind, Kingo became a film star (in the comics, he's an actor known for Japanese samurai films; in the film, he's a Bollywood performer). Powers: Fighting in style. Kingo can do what basically every Eternal can do -- kick butt with little effort, though he prefers to fend off foes with the panache of a leading man. He has the ego of one, too. Who knew? Kingo apparently fashions himself the star of the Eternals. Thena and Ikaris would like a word. GilgameshPlayed by: Don LeeThe strongest Eternal and Thena's partner, Gilgamesh is a fearsome warrior but also a pretty nice guy, according to Marvel. Powers: Indomitable strength. In battle, Gilgamesh employs a golden ""exoskeleton"" that protects his arms and fists and delivers devastating blows to enemies. Who knew? In the comics, he was known as ""the Forgotten One"" because he wasn't aware he was an Eternal for many years. DruigPlayed by: Barry KeoghanThere's a darkness to Druig that the other Eternals lack. In the comics, he's often prized his own success above the success of the Eternals and their mission to protect humans, which has made him dangerous. (Also in the comics, he's been drawn to resemble a vampire of sorts.) Powers: Mind control. Druig can see into humans' minds and exploit their vulnerabilities. Yikes!Who knew? Druig isolates himself from the other Eternals due to his, er, opposing view of how to live alongside humans, per Marvel. Bonus hero: Dane WhitmanPlayed by: Kit HaringtonOK, so, Whitman isn't a member of the Eternals, but he is Sersi's regular human boyfriend in the film. He may play a larger, more heroic role in upcoming Marvel projects, though nothing has been confirmed. We won't go into the finer details of his comic book history, but for readers who don't mind spoilers, Marvel has an expansive biography.

174,'Colin in Black & White' explores Colin Kaepernick's formative years but fumbles in its approach,"Colin Kaepernick possesses greater gifts as an athlete and activist than as a TV personality, which becomes apparent watching ""Colin in Black & White,"" a series that -- much like NBC's ""Young Rock"" -- revisits a famous person's early life, here by awkwardly mixing documentary and dramatic elements.As it happens, the Netflix show premieres the same day as another series connected to a pro athlete, NBA star Kevin Durant, who is among the producers of ""Swagger,"" an Apple TV+ series that looks at the often-unsavory, high-pressured world of youth basketball.""Colin"" is the higher-profile project, with Kaepernick having been left off an NFL roster since 2017, after taking a principled position over kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. Outspoken in the intervening period, the quarterback has teamed here with filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who directed the premiere of the six-episode series as well as the sequences in which Kaepernick speaks directly to the camera, illustrating his observations not only about his life but US history, race and inequality more broadly.Thanks to that hybrid format, ""Colin in Black & White"" feels stilted as Kaepernick stares intently at the camera discussing microaggressions, how Black people's advancement and acceptance invariably relies on ""a White man's stamp of approval,"" and occasionally watching reenacted scenes from his life.A more straightforward approach likely would have played better, and that structural fumble somewhat dilutes the dramatic sequences, which feature Kaepernick during his formative high-school years (well played by Jaden Michael). Mary-Louise Parker and Nick Offerman portray his adoptive parents, who at one point call him ""a thug"" because they disapprove of his hair, and often seem oblivious to indignities he faced from figures like police, hotel personnel and umpires, having excelled in baseball before settling on football as his chosen career path.Growing up with them, Kaepernick notes, ""I assumed their privilege was mine. I was in for a rude awakening.""At its core, the series serves as a venue to witness the racism Kaepernick experienced, conveyed in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, including the sidelong glances directed at a young Black man growing up in a predominantly White world. To those who only see professional athletes through the prism of wealth and fame, it's a reminder that they weren't always in that position.""Swagger"" covers similar territory, focusing on the pressure placed on teenagers in the pursuit to become NBA draft picks, beginning at a ridiculously young age.Here, the focus is on Jace (Isaiah Hill), a hugely talented 14-year-old who has ""NBA"" etched on his wall, a reminder of his ultimate goal as he participates in youth leagues and seeks to improve his game.His mother (Shinelle Azoroh) takes an active role in that, steering Jace to a youth coach (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) who was once a prized prospect himself, only to have lost that opportunity (a scenario explored via flashbacks) and now coaching as a way to stay close to basketball.Anyone familiar with the system -- from the shady role of agents to shoe companies trying to align themselves with future pros -- won't find a whole lot new here, and almost every episode seems to build toward a basketball game, complete with naysayers offering real-time commentary on social media.Durant joins other NBA stars -- including LeBron James and Stephen Curry -- by moonlighting in the production business, and ""Swagger"" has its moments. Yet for the most part, it plays more like a second-tier series than a blue-chip one.Similarly, it's possible to come away from ""Colin in Black & White"" with greater appreciation of Kaepernick's personal journey and what motivated him to take a stand at considerable personal cost, and still feel like they've used the wrong creative playbook to make this work as a TV show.""Colin in Black & White"" and ""Swagger"" premiere Oct. 29 on Netflix and Apple TV+, respectively.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211025215218-02-colin-in-black-and-white-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/27/entertainment/colin-in-black-and-white-review/index.html,2021-10-27T14:19.000Z,80.0,entertainment
175,'Queens' gets the band back together for a soapy ABC drama,"""Queens"" is an extremely familiar idea, elevated not quite to the level of royalty by being slickly cast, packaged and produced. Like Peacock's ""Girls5eva,"" the concept hinges on an all-girl group reunited and again pursuing stardom 20 years later, rediscovering the spotlight and its perils after years spent braiding hair and burning breakfast.Those last mundane activities are how we meet Brianna (Eve), once known as Professor Sex, who is now raising five kids. Methodically, the show goes about introducing the rest of the quartet once known as the Nasty Bitches (a name itself rooted in the past), who, as Jill a.k.a. Da Thrill (Naturi Naughton), notes, ""stood on top of the world for a hot minute.""The other members of the group, Naomi/Xplicit Lyrics (Brandy) and Valeria/Butter Pecan (Nadine Velazquez), had a sour falling out, with the former toiling away as a solo act -- ""still chasing the fame that you found 20 years ago,"" as she's told -- and the latter having successfully transitioned into morning TV, where her unbridled ambition is on full display.It's their manager (Taylor Sele) who suggests getting the band back together as part of a televised event, and the lure of a quick payout is enough to erode the resistance on several fronts. But this is a series, after all, so the reunion won't end there, with the challenge of mounting a formal comeback and all the soapy doings that go with it.As noted, the idea of one-time stars nursing old grudges and grasping for another few minutes of fame is hardly a new one (Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" is an ode to one-hit wonders), but the hip-hop backdrop and casting gives ""Queens"" a relatively fresh feel. The disclaimer would be that once you get past the premise, the series becomes another soap set against the backdrop of the music world, a la ""Empire,"" meaning it will only be as good as the situations that the writers can continue to conjure.Produced by ""Scandal"" alum Zahir McGhee (who wrote the pilot) and directed by Tim Story, ""Queens"" appears to be in pretty good hands on that score, even if the content and actually-not-that-explicit lyrics can only be as nasty as ABC's standards will allow. The show also figures to get a boost, in old-fashioned TV scheduling terms, from having ""The Bachelorette"" as its opening act.For now, ""Queens"" has done an admirable job assembling the pieces. Keeping them from flaming out the way that the show's fictional group did could be another matter.""Queens"" premieres Oct. 19 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210902034712-01-queens-abc-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/entertainment/queens-review/index.html,2021-10-19T17:09.000Z,80.0,entertainment
176,'Succession' doesn't miss a beat as its Murdochian family feud continues,"Success hasn't spoiled ""Succession,"" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of ""Veep"" blush.Having become HBO's version of ""Game of Thrones"" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211012181811-01-succession-season-3-episode-1-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/15/entertainment/succession-season-3-review/index.html,2021-10-15T12:11.000Z,80.0,entertainment
177,'The Wonder Years' shines in ABC's reboot of the coming-of-age dramedy,"Early '90s TV is hitting the refresh button this fall, in the case of ""The Wonder Years,"" delivering an impressive and ambitious ABC dramedy. Coming on the heels of Disney+'s ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" reboot, the two shows join the earlier ""One Day at a Time"" in proving it's possible to nostalgically recycle titles and still produce distinctive and captivating series.Directed by original star Fred Savage, ""The Wonder Years"" revisits roughly the same period beginning in 1968, this time examining those turbulent years from the perspective of an African-American family and its 12-year-old son, Dean (Elisha ""EJ"" Williams).Once again featuring narration by a grown-up version of the kid (courtesy of Don Cheadle), the elder voice amusingly recalls an era when spanking kids was perfectly okay, his father (""The West Wing's"" Dulé Hill) responded to stressful situations by telling everyone ""Be cool"" and both parents (Saycon Sengbloh plays his mom) were fond of snapping at their kids, ""Stay out of grown folks' business.""As the youngest of three, Dean watches the tumult of the '60s at a greater sense of remove than his teenage sister (Laura Kariuki) and mostly seems preoccupied with a girl in his class, Keisa (Milan Ray). A lot might change in filtering the show through this different point of view, but the pangs of puberty remain universal.Adapted by Saladin K. Patterson, working with a production team that includes Savage and ""Empire's"" Lee Daniels, this new ""Wonder Years"" finds a great deal of humor in seeing the past from this distance. Set in Montgomery, Alabama, Dean attends Jefferson Davis Jr. High and is told reassuringly that a White person isn't racist because ""he watches 'I, Spy.'""Like the prior version, the show unearths the drama and poignant qualities of those years, in a front-loaded pilot that leverages a major event to set the scene and mood -- a logical decision, if a device that the writers will be hard-pressed to replicate in terms of emotional resonance going forward.Both this show and ""Doogie Kamealoha, M.D."" have also nailed the casting of their youthful leads, no small feat with such exercises, with Williams capturing the mix of naivete and awakening that's key to coming-of-age fare.In terms of old-fashioned scheduling concerns that were far more significant when the original aired, ""The Wonder Years"" also looks right at home sandwiched between the nostalgia-tinged ""The Goldbergs"" and ""The Conners,"" a Roseanne-less revival of another '90s staple. (Scheduling isn't a consideration, of course, for those who'll just stream it later on Hulu.)Whether the series can sustain the charms and deft balance that its pilot exhibits remains to be seen; still, just getting out of the gate this looks like one of the fall's most appealing shows, in a way that manages to be, as a musical remnant of the era put it, some kind of ""Wonder""-full.""The Wonder Years"" premieres Sept. 22 at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210902034520-02-the-wonder-years-reboot-abc-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/22/entertainment/the-wonder-years-review/index.html,2021-09-22T15:45.000Z,80.0,entertainment
178,"From 'Reservation Dogs' to 'Rutherford Falls,' Native people are having a moment on TV ","When the character Bear is visited by the spirit of an unknown warrior in the series premiere of ""Reservation Dogs,"" he asks if the man before him is ""Crazy Horse"" or another legendary Native American leader.It turns out, however, that the man in the beads and feathers is not the kind of brave or formidable Native hero long romanticized in Hollywood. The unknown warrior instead departed this earth in a most anticlimactic fashion -- his horse tripped over a gopher hole and squashed him dead before the battle even started.""The spirit world is cold,"" he tells Bear. ""My nipples are always hard."" It's a deeply clever and funny scene, one that flips the tired trope of the Indigenous warrior on its head. It winks at Native viewers in the audience, who are all too used to seeing stereotypical portrayals of their people on screen. And it gently mocks those who still think of Native people as relics of the past, as if to say, ""C'mon ... really?""""It's bringing non-Natives into the joke and saying, 'Hey, this is what you think we look like and we're gonna let you laugh at it with us,'"" Sterlin Harjo, a Seminole and Muscogee filmmaker who created ""Reservation Dogs"" with Taika Waititi, told CNN. ""'But it's crazy that you think we still dress like that.'""That tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the elements that makes ""Reservation Dogs,"" the FX series that premiered on Hulu last week, so refreshing. It's also one of two comedies on TV right now about Native Americans, by Native Americans -- ""Rutherford Falls,"" the sitcom that premiered on Peacock earlier this year, has also garnered attention for its layered characters, culturally specific stories and delightful humor.It shouldn't be all that remarkable to see Indigenous people living their lives and having fun on TV, those in the industry say. But when you consider the landscape of onscreen Native representation before this year, the two shows are downright revolutionary.They show Native characters as multidimensionalBefore ""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls,"" the only time Native people really appeared on screen was when ""they were being shot by John Wayne or giving mystical advice to a White person,"" said comedian Joey Clift. A lot of the time, the actors playing Native people weren't even Native themselves.What's different about ""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls"" is that they show Native Americans as multidimensional and existing in the modern era. And rather than having one or two Native characters, they depict entire communities of Indigenous people. ""It's really a breath of fresh air for Native representation,"" Clift, a member of the Cowlitz Tribe, told CNN.""Reservation Dogs"" centers on four rebellious Indigenous teens in rural Oklahoma who yearn to escape to ostensibly greener pastures in California. Along the way, they steal a chip truck, sell meat pies outside of an Indian Health Service clinic and get into fights with a rival crew.""Rutherford Falls"" doesn't focus entirely on Native people, but they are featured on the show in a big way. The series follows a pair of lifelong friends -- Nathan Rutherford, who is White, and Reagan Wells, who is a member of the fictional Minishonka Nation -- whose relationship is put to the test when their small town wants to remove a statue of Nathan's ancestor. As Nathan works to preserve the statue, he finds himself at odds with one of the leaders of Reagan's tribe. The series was recently renewed for another season.Sierra Teller Ornelas, a Navajo and Mexican American showrunner, told CNN that when her co-creators Ed Helms and Michael Schur first approached her about the idea that would eventually become ""Rutherford Falls,"" she knew she wanted the show to have as many Native characters as possible. She wanted to capture the diversity and range of experiences that being Indigenous can encompass. So she did, bringing on Native writers from different backgrounds, tribal nations and regions of the country.""That led to just not only more authentic stories but also better storytelling and funnier ideas,"" she said.They have authentic and specific storiesIn the second episode of ""Reservation Dogs,"" the character Elora ends up at the Indian Health Service clinic for the stomach pains she got from eating too many hot chips. There, she encounters a sarcastic receptionist who can't help but respond to her with withering looks and biting comebacks.Crystal Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and president and CEO of IllumiNative, said she and her daughter cried from laughter while watching the scene -- it was just so familiar. Once when her daughter was younger, she too had to go to the doctor for eating too many hot chips.For other Native people to see themselves reflected in small ways like these is huge, Echo-Hawk said.""We've been told for too long that our stories are too specific to our community and that nobody will get us if we're not in leather and feathers,"" she added. ""'Rutherford Falls' and 'Reservation Dogs' have totally flipped that myth because clearly Americans from all backgrounds like these stories.""That specificity extends to the smaller details too, like when the characters in ""Reservation Dogs"" use the slang terms ""Skoden"" and ""Stoodis."" The shows don't work too hard to explain themselves, staying authentic all while maintaining a universal appeal -- a product of having creative teams and writers' rooms filled with Indigenous people.""We're not holding anyone's hand into this experience,"" Harjo said. ""We are dropping you in the middle of a Native community -- and that's risky.""They capture Native joy""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls"" don't completely ignore the challenges found in Indian Country, but they don't dwell too much on it either.Instead, the focus here is on Native joy.""Reservation Dogs"" was born out of Harjo and Waititi -- who is of Māori descent -- swapping funny stories from back home with each other, Harjo said. The onscreen stories that had existed about Native people up until then were all depressing, and they wanted to make something that would capture just how funny and quirky their communities were. ""Humor was a part of our survival,"" Harjo added. ""To see it not reflected on screen forever was really strange.""The characters in the shows have dreams, aspirations and romantic interests. They get into mischief and crack jokes at each others' expense. Simply put, they're allowed to be.After a pandemic that hit Native people particularly hard, said Ornelas, that joy is a welcome relief.""It's just been a wonderful experience to see that Native joy and to feel like we helped to create that in the show,"" she said.With the success of ""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls,"" there's perhaps never been a more exciting time for Native American representation on TV. The two shows have set a baseline for what authentic, nuanced depictions of Indigenous people can look like, and have shown that there's an appetite for those stories, too.Already, there's more Native-led storytelling to look forward to: ""Spirit Rangers,"" an animated series about three siblings who can turn into animal spirits to protect their national parks, and ""Rez Ball,"" a coming of age film about a Navajo high school basketball team. Both are being made for Netflix.That momentum is a sign, many say, of bigger and better things to come.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210813101929-01-reservation-dogs-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/18/entertainment/native-american-tv-representation-trnd/index.html,2021-08-18T18:55.000Z,80.0,entertainment
