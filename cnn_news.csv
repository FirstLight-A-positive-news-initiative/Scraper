0,"Koalas are dying from chlamydia, and climate change is making it worse","A silent killer is spreading through Australia's koala population, posing a threat that wildlife experts say could wipe out the iconic marsupial across large parts of the country.The culprit is chlamydia, a sexually transmitted virus that infects more than 100 million people worldwide annually and can cause infertility in humans if left untreated.For koalas, uncontrolled chlamydia can cause blindness and painful cysts in a animal's reproductive tract that may lead to infertility or even death. Worse still, antibiotics used to treat the disease can destroy the delicate gut flora koalas need to consume their staple diet of eucalyptus leaves, leading some to starve to death even after being cured.The disease can also spread quickly. In 2008, there was a ""very, very low chlamydial prevalence"" -- about 10% -- in the koala population in Gunnedah, a rural town in northeast New South Wales, according to Mark Krockenberger, a professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Sydney. By 2015, that figure had risen to as high as 60%. Now, about 85% of that koala population is infected with the virus, Krockenberger said.""If you think about it, that's not a viable population anymore because of infertility. Pretty much every female that's infected with chlamydia becomes infertile within a year, maybe two years maximum ... Even if they survive, they're not breeding,"" he said.Experts say situations like that in Gunnedah are playing out among koala populations across Australia, threatening populations already vulnerable to worsening bushfires and habitat loss due to deforestation.Scientists are now trialing vaccines against chlamydia to protect the animals.""We run a very high risk, if this vaccine strategy doesn't work ... of localized extinctions,"" Krockenberger said.Are koalas endangered in Australia?There are few more emblematic Australian animals than the koala. The gray, fluffy-eared marsupial, which eats leaves from the eucalyptus tree and carries its young in its pouch, can only be found in Australia and is regularly seen in cultural representations of the country.But koalas face a number of threats to their survival. Apart from disease, the marsupials suffer habitat loss and are often attacked by wild dogs and hit by cars.The koala is listed as ""vulnerable"" on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List, which catalogs species at risk of extinction. The IUCN says there are between 100,000 and half a million koalas in the wild, but the Australian Koala Foundation says the number is closer to 58,000. Confusion about the size of Australia's koala population inspired the government to commit 2 million Australian dollars ($1.47 million) last year to a national koala census to work out where they are and how many are left.The country's koala population suffered severe losses during the catastrophic bushfires of 2019, which destroyed more than 12 million acres (48,000 squares kilometers) of land across New South Wales alone.The fires killed or displaced nearly 3 billion animals, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). That figure includes more than 60,000 koalas that either died, lost their habitat or suffered injury, trauma, smoke inhalation and heat stress from the flames.In mid-2021, an Australian government report on the conservation status of koalas recommended the animal's status be changed to ""endangered"" in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, as a result of the rapid population decline in those areas. In some regions, the report found populations had almost halved over just 20 years.The Australian government is drafting a National Recovery Plan for the Koala which will be reviewed in December 2021 before potentially becoming law in 2022. But Deborah Tabart, chairman of the Australian Koala Foundation, says much more needs to be done to protect koalas and their habitat across the entire country, warning the marsupials could be wiped out within three generations. ""We want a Koala Protection Act,"" she said. ""If you really are serious about protecting this species you would have legislation that is effective and that means protecting the trees,"" she said.Campaigners say it would be akin to the Bald Eagle Act in the United States that protects the country's national emblem from threats to its population and habitat. How does chlamydia spread?When faced with the threats to the koala's habitat and food supply, chlamydia might seem like a secondary issue. But with numbers dwindling, experts said reproduction has never been more important.There are two varieties of chlamydia in Australian koalas, one of which, chlamydia pecorum, is almost entirely responsible for the most severe cases of the disease in the population. A paper published in September 2020 in FEMS Microbiology Reviews said the more dangerous strain of chlamydia may have originated in domestic livestock brought to Australia by European colonizers in the 19th century.The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating, though joeys -- baby koalas -- can catch the disease from their mothers.According to the University of Sydney, infection rates in some populations of mainland koalas in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria can be as high as 100%, rendering them entirely infertile.Highlighting the virus' lethal potential, a study in the Journal of Applied Ecology in March 2018 found that of 291 koalas examined over four years, 18% had died of chlamydia or related complications.  Disease was the second highest cause of death, after animal attacks.Climate change is making the problem worseThe climate crisis has made Australia more vulnerable to devastating bushfires, such as those seen in 2019, as well as drought and heatwaves. It's also making koalas more susceptible to disease.According to Australia's leading scientific body, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the country has already warmed by about 1.44 degrees on average since 1910.The Australian government report said when the marsupials are exposed to unusually stressful environmental conditions, including ""hot weather, drought, habitat loss and fragmentation,"" chlamydia spreads more quickly through their population.Experts say they have witnessed similar rapid explosions of disease in the wild. Krockenberger said in his Gunnedah sample population, a series of heatwaves and droughts in 2009 and 2010 preceded a doubling of chlamydia cases.Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at University of Sunshine Coast in Australia, said once koalas' stress hormones rise due to environmental problems, infections often progress from a relatively minor problem to ""one that is more serious.""He said a combination of habitat loss and climate change is causing koalas to be ""chronically stressed,"" depressing their immune systems.""All that leads to poor chlamydia response. It gets them from low grade chlamydia infections to more serious disease,"" he said.""That's what we're doing to them. And we're doing it on all fronts.""Chlamydia vaccine trials for koalasBut help could be on the way for Australia's koalas.A chlamydia vaccine, developed by researcher Timms over the past decade, is being tested among the country's koala population as a way to protect the animals from serious infections.Control trials are ongoing to test the effectiveness of the vaccine on small groups of koalas -- often about 20 or 30 at a time, Timms said. The current trial is the largest yet, involving 400 koalas.Some koalas are vaccinated when they are brought to veterinary hospitals with complaints other than chlamydia, while others are given the shot as part of coexisting conservation efforts, he added.""We know the vaccine can reduce the infection rate,"" Timms said. ""It doesn't reduce it to zero. There are no vaccines that do that, but it quashes the infection load way down.""He said while it is hoped the process will reduce the infection rate, it is hard to monitor the spread of chlamydia in a wild population.University of Sydney's Krockenberger, who is involved in a separate vaccine trial, said the purpose of the drug isn't to reverse the progress of the disease in individual koalas. ""Once they're chronically infected, they're often able to live reasonably happily, they just can't breed,"" he said.He said instead the hope is that by reducing the levels of infectiousness in koalas with chlamydia, researchers will be able to prevent the virus from spreading to new hosts and thereby maintain a breeding population.""We also hope that the unaffected animals, when they're vaccinated, are more resistant to picking up the infection,"" he said.Timms said once the vaccine is proved to be safe and effective, he hopes to roll it out to wildlife hospitals around Australia to vaccinate any koalas who come through their doors.He said that people often ask him how he is going to vaccinate ""the last koala in the last tree"" for chlamydia, to which Timms responds he's ""not even going to try."" All he can do is try to save as much of the population as possible.After all, ""these are wild animals,"" he said.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211104215814-01-australia-koala-chlamydia-intl-hnk-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/06/australia/australia-koala-chlamydia-intl-dst-hnk/index.html,politics
3,Death of pregnant woman ignites debate about abortion ban in Poland,"The death of a pregnant Polish woman has reignited debate over abortion in one of Europe's most devoutly Catholic countries, with activists saying she could still be alive if it were not for a near total ban on terminating pregnancies.Tens of thousands of Poles took to the streets to protest in January this year when a Constitutional Tribunal ruling from October 2020 that terminating pregnancies with fetal defects was unconstitutional came into effect, eliminating the most frequently used case for legal abortion.Activists say Izabela, a 30-year-old woman in the 22nd week of pregnancy who her family said died of septic shock after doctors waited for her unborn baby's heart to stop beating, is the first woman to die as a result of the ruling.The government says the ruling was not to blame for her death, rather an error by doctors.Izabela went to hospital in September after her waters broke, her family said. Scans had previously shown numerous defects in the fetus.""The baby weighs 485 grams. For now, thanks to the abortion law, I have to lie down. And there is nothing they can do. They'll wait until it dies or something begins, and if not, I can expect sepsis,"" Izabela said in a text message to her mother, private broadcaster TVN24 reported.When a scan showed the fetus was dead, doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, southern Poland, decided to perform a Caesarean. The family's lawyer, Jolanta Budzowska, said Izabela's heart stopped on the way to the operating theater and she died despite efforts to resuscitate her.""I couldn't believe it, I thought it wasn't true,"" Izabela's mother Barbara told TVN24. ""How could such a thing happen to her in the hospital? After all, she went there for help.""Budzowska has started legal action over the treatment Izabela received, accusing doctors of malpractice, but she also called the death ""a consequence of the verdict"".In a statement on its website, the Pszczyna County Hospital said it shared the pain of all those affected by Izabela's death, especially her family.""It should ... be emphasized that all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland,"" the hospital said.On Friday, the hospital said it had suspended two doctors who were on duty at the time of the death.The Supreme Medical Chamber, which represents Polish doctors, said it was not immediately able to comment.Not one moreWhen the case came to public attention as a result of a tweet from Budzowska, the hashtag #anijednejwiecej or ""not one more"" spread across social media and was taken up by protesters demanding a change to the law.However, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party rejects claims that the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was to blame for Izabela's death, attributing it to a mistake by doctors.""When it comes to the life and health of the mother ... if it is in danger, then terminating the pregnancy is possible and the ruling does not change anything,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday.PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski told Reuters that the case should not be ""instrumentalized and used to limit the right to life, to kill all sick or disabled children.""But activists say the ruling has made doctors scared to terminate pregnancies even when the mother's life is at risk.""Izabela's case clearly shows that the ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal has had a chilling effect on doctors,"" Urszula Grycuk of the Federation for Women and Family Planning told Reuters.""Even a condition that should not be questioned -- the life and health of the mother -- is not always recognized by doctors because they are afraid.""In Ireland, the death of 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar in 2012 after she was refused a termination provoked a national outpouring of grief credited by many as a catalyst for the liberalization of abortion laws.Budzowska told Reuters that a debate similar to the one that took place in Ireland was underway in Poland.""Both Izabela's family and I personally hope that this case ... will lead to a change in the law in Poland,"" she said.Poland's president proposed changing the law last year to make abortions possible in cases where the fetus was not viable. The Law and Justice dominated parliament has yet to debate the bill.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211107090155-poland-abortion-protest-11-06-2021-iza-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/europe/poland-abortion-ban-march-intl/index.html,politics
4,A dangerous crisis is brewing in the Balkans. Will the West do anything to stop another war?,"The Balkan state of Bosnia-Herzegovina is on the verge of what analysts warn is its most serious crisis since the end of the Bosnian war in 1995, in which thousands were killed and horrendous acts of ethnic cleansing were committed. The international community's High Representative in Bosnia, Christian Schmidt, warned earlier this week that the US-brokered peace agreement signed at the end of the war is at risk of collapsing unless action is taken to stop Serbian separatists from pushing towards secession.Milorad Dodik, the Serbian leader in Bosnia's three-person presidency, has over time repeatedly threatened to break away from the rest of the country, which has since the war been made up of two autonomous regions linked by a central government. This time, however, he is putting some flesh on the bones by introducing legislation that would divorce Republika Srpska (Serb Republic) from the state's joint institutions like the armed forces and judicial bodies. ""This is tantamount to secession without proclaiming it,"" Schmidt told the UN Security Council, which met this week to reauthorize the longstanding mission of the European Union-led peacekeeping force EUFOR.In a country where ethnic divisions between Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats led to war crimes being committed in recent history, this level of tension is making observers very nervous.""There is no question that this is by far the most dangerous crisis since 1995 and that it could lead to another war,"" said Ismail Cidic, president of the Bosnian Advocacy Center, an independent NGO that advocates for a free, sovereign, democratic and secular Bosnia-Herzegovina.Why is it happening now? Sectarian tensions between the communities have persisted ever since the end of the war and signing of the US-brokered Dayton agreement.The treaty ended the three-and-a-half-year war by dividing the state along ethnic lines, into the Serb Republic and the Federation, which is shared by both Bosniaks and Croats. The two regions are tied together by a three-person presidency, international envoys, and a central government. No peace treaty can erase the murder, systemic rape and other horrors people lived through during the war, but one incident lingers in the memory more than others: the Srebrenica massacre that took place between July 11-22, 1995. Thousands of Muslim men and boys were murdered by Bosnian Serb forces. Their leaders were later convicted of war crimes and the massacre has been recognized as a genocide by the international community. However, not all Serbs are willing to accept this. One such person is Dodik -- who has been particularly irked by the recent introduction of a law by the High Commissioner's office that could hand prison sentences to anyone who denies that genocide was committed.Earlier this year, he said of the law: ""This is the nail in Bosnia's coffin ... The Republika Srpska has no other option but to start the ... dissolution."" How bad could things get?Observers fear that even if Dodik doesn't move towards secession, his actions could be seriously destabilizing and cause violence, forced migration and abject misery for ordinary people. ""Citizens throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina -- including in the entity of Republika Srpska -- fear violence,"" said Arminka Helić, a Bosnian-born politician who is now a member of the British House of Lords and former special advisor to the British foreign secretary. ""A further move towards secession would likely lead to a reaction. There is no way the breakup of Bosnia Herzegovina can be done peacefully.""Heather Staff, an advisor at RAMP Project, an organization specializing in migration policy, warns that ""violent conflict will lead to a refugee crisis, and displaced people -- in the 90s and 2000s we saw people fleeing Bosnia to neighboring countries such as Montenegro.""She says this is a region ""where rhetoric at times has been harsh regarding the treatment of asylum seekers ... how would those fleeing be treated in neighboring countries?""The impact would of course be felt beyond the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina.Jasmin Mujanović, author of the book 'Hunger and Fury: The Crisis of Democracy in the Balkans,' said it would be a ""catastrophe for the European Union and the Atlantic community more broadly, as it would be yet another security crisis in an already extremely volatile southeast of Europe."" He pointed out that with security crises already existing in Ukraine, Belarus, Syria and Afghanistan ""a significant deterioration in the security and stability of Bosnia is something that both the EU and the US can ill afford.""As is so often the case in geopolitics, a poke in the eye for the West provides an opportunity for rivals like Russia and China. A senior EU official told CNN of their concern at how the situation could be exploited. ""We are stuck between a rock and a hard place. The international community cannot be seen to be victimizing the Serbs, as it pushes them and Serbia further into Russia's arms. But the Balkans are on the EU's doorstep. Increased Russian influence in the region gives them another foothold and platform for influence, if they want to destabilize things further.""Who is to blame?Many in the West accept in private that it has thus far failed to step up to the plate and it might now be too late. Multiple sources in the EU, NATO and the wider European diplomatic community expressed regret at the West's historic failure to place sanctions or act otherwise against those fanning the flames in Bosnia-Herzegovina. ""Dodik and his clique of secessionists and genocide deniers have been appeased consistently for 15 years by the international community. He has been talking about -- and moving towards -- secession since 2006,"" said Helic.  Mujanović said that while neighboring Serbia and Russia are the ""primary architects of this crisis,"" he does believe that ""the refusal of the international community -- in particular, the NATO states -- to decisively act to nip this in the bud years ago"" has emboldened Dodik and his supporters. Mujanović pointed specifically at the EU, which he said had been ""extremely underwhelming"" due to its own internal discord, making the bloc ""at this point in many ways a non-factor."" What can be done?""The international community has a clear mandate to protect peace in Bosnia,"" said Cidic. ""Any escalation of violence in Bosnia could harm them tremendously as they cannot afford a Russia-backed conflict, entangled with Chinese and other interests, on NATO's borders.""But will the West do anything? A NATO official told CNN: ""We urge Russia to play a constructive role in the Western Balkans. We regularly see Russia doing the opposite. NATO works to promote stability, security and cooperation in the region. Any outside interference in domestic democratic processes is unacceptable.""Obviously, NATO could only act on the orders of its member states, and there's no indication that anything beyond tough words will come any time soon. The senior EU official said that there is political will to do something more substantial among some EU member states but acknowledges it will be very difficult to get all 27 on board without some major concessions to countries within the bloc on other issues. The UN Security Council can't act without Russia, which earlier this week only voted to keep peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina once the High Representative's name was removed from the text of the resolution, undermining the credibility of that office. However, there is some reason for hope. Mujanović says that EU member states could ""enact unilateral sanctions against"" Dodik and his cronies, which he believes would have some impact. But diplomacy didn't work in the 1990s, and Cidic does not believe it will work now. ""This failed diplomatic approach resulted in over 100,000 perished, and over 1.1 million refugees,"" he said. That harder approach could be sanctions, combined with treating secessionist moves as a European ""security challenge,"" Helic said. ""We have to roll this back. The sooner we do it the better and easier it is. We don't want to wait for years like we did in the 1990s."" It's hard to see the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina getting better in the immediate future. However, with sufficient political will, powerful actors could prevent it from sliding back into violence. The question is whether powerful Western nations are too distracted to pay sufficient attention to a state that isn't at the top of their priority list right now -- and even if they're willing to act, whether they might find they're too late.

5,Camels escape from circus and venture out to explore Madrid,"Spanish police had an unusual encounter on Friday night when a number of camels and a llama escaped from a circus and wandered onto the Madrid streets. The animals were from the Gran Circo Quiros in the Spanish capital, and were located at around 5 a.m. local time and guided back safely by police officers. Spain's national police confirmed the news on Twitter, sharing images of the animals walking along the streets and signed off with the hashtag #WeLoveAnimals.On its Instagram page, the circus said that it had ""suffered an animal sabotage"" on Friday night but confirmed that ""the animals are well."" CNN has reached out to the circus for comment.Bactrian camels are originally native to central and Eastern Asia and are usually more accustomed to desert terrain than the streets of Madrid, although they are able to survive in a variety of extreme conditions.

7,Russian diplomat found dead on street outside Berlin embassy,"A Russian diplomat found dead on the sidewalk outside the embassy in Berlin last month is believed by German authorities to have been a secret agent for a Russian intelligence agency, Der Spiegel magazine reported Friday. The body of the 35-year-old diplomat was found on the morning of October 19; he apparently fell from an upper floor of the Russian embassy building in the German capital, though it was unclear why he fell or what the cause of death was, Der Spiegel reported. Der Spiegel and investigative site Bellingcat report that the dead diplomat had been accredited as second secretary at the Russian embassy in Berlin since 2019, but German security officials believe he was an undercover officer for Russia's FSB, the internal security and counterintelligence service, and that he was related to a high-ranking FSB officer.The FSB was previously linked by Western intelligence services to the murder of a Georgian exile who was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, Der Spiegel and Bellingcat reported. The Kremlin has denied any link between the killing and the Russian state. The Russian embassy did not agree to an autopsy of the diplomat, and the his diplomatic immunity meant that Germany's public prosecutor could not carry out an investigation, Der Spiegel reported Friday. Russian and German officials acknowledged the death of the diplomat on Friday following the Der Spiegel report. ""A tragic accident with a Russian diplomat occurred on October 19, 2021,"" the Russian embassy said in a statement. ""All the formalities related to sending the diplomat's body to his homeland were promptly settled with the competent law enforcement and medical authorities of Germany in accordance with the current practice.""""We consider the speculation that appeared in a number of Western media in the context of this tragic incident to be absolutely incorrect.""A spokeswoman at the German foreign ministry told CNN the government was aware of the death of the diplomat, but due to ""reasons of personal protection of the persons concerned and their relatives, no further details will be disclosed at this moment.""The death of the diplomat came nearly a year after an investigation by CNN and Bellingcat revealed that an FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny for more than three years before he was poisoned in August 2020 with the lethal nerve agent Novichok.One of the FSB agents was later duped into telling Navalny over the phone that the Novichok had been planted in his underpants -- a detail that emerged when Navalny posed as a member of Russia's National Security Council and called the agent to press him for details of the operation, as was revealed exclusively in another CNN-Bellingcat investigation.

11,Sheikh Jarrah families facing threat of forced eviction reject Israeli high court proposal ,"Seven Palestinian families facing the threat of forced eviction from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah have rejected a proposal from Israel's High Court that justices said could resolve the decades-long dispute. The court asked the families to submit their response by Tuesday to a plan that would see them offered protected tenancy status for 15 years in exchange for accepting -- via a rental payment of 2,400 shekels ($750) per year -- that the land belongs to Nahalat Shimon Limited, a Jewish settler organization seeking to develop the area for Jewish housing. Announcing their position at a press conference in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, family members said the court proposal was a means of temporarily delaying plans to remove them from their homes and confiscate land. The families have been living in Sheikh Jarrah since the 1950s after fleeing homes the previous decade in Haifa, Jaffa and other towns which became part of the state of Israel. They say their situation is unfair because they are not able to reclaim those original homes, while standing to lose residences for which they gave up their refugee status more than 60 years ago. Tensions in the neighborhood rose earlier this year when it appeared the case was coming to a conclusion, and which Hamas used in part as a pretext for firing rockets at Jerusalem, triggering an 11-day war between Gaza militants and the Israeli army. A Hamas-linked organization had made clear its opposition to the High Court proposal, writing in a letter to one of the lawyers involved that they had a ""national, moral and legal responsibility"" to reject it. Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority, also said it had ""clearly informed the families and their lawyers that we are categorically against the proposal, and we will stand by them and will not allow them to be thrown into the street."" But family members denied that they had taken their decision under duress, saying they had reached it independently. There has been no response from the High Court, but justices have previously said that if their proposal was rejected they would issue a binding decision at some point.

12,Sudan internet cuts complicate civil disobedience campaign against coup,"Sudanese pro-democracy groups launched two days of civil disobedience and strikes on Sunday in protest at last month's military coup, though participation appeared to be limited by continuing interruptions to internet and phone connections.Local ""resistance committees"" and the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which led demonstrations in the uprising that toppled then-president Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, are organizing a campaign of protests to try to reverse the military takeover.People were out on Sunday on the streets in the center of the capital, Khartoum, though there was less traffic than usual, residents said.A teachers' union said security forces used tear gas at the education ministry building for Khartoum State to break up a sit-in staged to oppose any handover to military appointees. Some 87 people were arrested, it said.In the Burri neighborhood of Khartoum and across the river in the Ombada area of Omdurman, police also used tear gas to break up protests, eyewitnesses said.There were protests too in the cities of Medani, Nyala, and Atbara, where hundreds protested the re-appointment of Bashir loyalists in local government, eyewitnesses said.Internet disruptionSome hospitals and medical staff in Khartoum were working normally while others were on strike.""A number of people did not know about the call for civil disobedience because of the internet cut,"" said one resident in central Khartoum who asked not to be named.Internet services have been badly disrupted since the October 25 coup, and phone coverage remains patchy. Although daily life came to a near standstill, shops, roads, and some banks have since reopened.The coup halted a power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilians that had been agreed after Bashir's overthrow and was meant to lead to democratic elections by late 2023.Top civilians including several ministers were detained, and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was placed under house arrest.Since the coup, mediation efforts involving the United Nations have sought the release of detainees and a return to power sharing, but sources from the ousted government say those efforts have stalled.On Sunday, the commander in chief of the military, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, met an Arab League delegation, which stressed the importance of dialog and the democratic transition, his office said in a statement.Burhan told the delegation the military was committed to achieving ""the Sudanese people's ambitions,"" the statement said.Activists demanding that the military exit politics have announced a schedule of protests leading up to mass rallies on November 13 under the slogan ""No negotiation, no partnership, no compromise.""Hundreds of thousands took to the streets against military rule in two demonstrations before and after the October 25 coup.Western powers have paused economic assistance to Sudan and say that relief on tens of billions of dollars of foreign debt is at risk unless there is a return to democratic transition.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211107092214-01-sudan-coup-protests-1104-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/africa/sudan-protests-internet-blocked-coup-intl/index.html,politics
13,At least 98 killed in Sierra Leone fuel tanker explosion,"At least 98 people died on Friday after a fuel tanker exploded in a suburb of Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, according to authorities in the West African country.Mohamed Lamrane Bah, director of communications for Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), told CNN that several people were also in critical condition following the explosion.Authorities have transferred injured people to hospitals and collected the bodies, and the rescue effort at the scene has ended, Bah added.The explosion occurred after two vehicles collided on the highway while the fuel tanker was about to enter a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel, the NDMA said in a statement posted to Facebook on Saturday afternoon.""Footage and eyewitnesses intimated that while the collision took place, both drivers came out of their vehicles and warned community residents to stay off the scene while trying to address a leakage emanating from the collision,"" the statement said. It added that while that was happening, ""some community members rushed to the scene and took advantage of the leakage to scoop fuel and store it in nearby makeshift structures.""""In the cause of scooping the fuel, there was a major explosion that resulted in the fire disaster that occurred,"" it said.The NDMA immediately visited the scene and coordinated emergency response with partners. Ambulances were assembled to take corpses and those in critical situations to various hospitals in Freetown.There have been 92 people admitted to hospitals within Freetown, the NDMA statement said.Freetown Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr said in a statement on Facebook that she was ""saddened to hear about an explosion along Bai Bureh Road, Wellington, after a truck carrying fuel collided with another truck.""""The video and photo footage making rounds on social media are harrowing,"" Aki-Sawyerr added.""My sympathies go out to the families and loved ones of the victims of the explosion.

16,'Go be happy': Thousands of baby river turtles released in Peruvian jungle,"Some 3,000 baby river turtles native to the Amazon rainforest were released into a Peruvian river on Thursday after hatching from eggs kept on artificial beaches as part of a conservation effort.The river turtles are considered ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and have for many years been killed for human consumption, or kept as pets.""The importance lies in the conservation of the species in the area because it has already been threatened for a long time,"" said Sabrina Pipa, a biologist who works on the protection of freshwater turtles.""The objective is the repopulation of the species.""The turtles carry the scientific name Podocnemis unifilis, but Peruvians call them taricayas. They are yellow-spotted and the baby ones measure just a couple of inches.Peru has the second largest share of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil.Scientists agree that conserving the Amazon rainforest is vital to avoid catastrophic climate change because of its ability to absorb greenhouse gases.But over the past two decades, more than 19,700 square kilometers (7,600 square miles) of the Peruvian Amazon have been destroyed.Pipa said the taricaya project began in 2019 and had protected about 6,000 river turtles, in addition to those conserved this year.People gathered in the city of Iquitos to see the baby turtles make their way down a river beach towards the water.""Go!

17,"Marília Mendonça, chart-topping Brazilian musician, dies in plane crash","Brazilian country music star Marília Mendonça died in a plane crash on Friday in a rural region of the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, according to her public relations firm.She was en route to a concert at the time of the crash, which killed four other people in addition to the singer. Mendonça, 26, is survived by her 1-year-old son, according to CNN Brasil.The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but in a statement on Friday, the Minas Gerais Electric Company (CEMIG) said Mendonça's plane had hit a cable on an electric tower belonging to the power firm.Minas Gerais police chief Ivan Lopes Sales said at a news conference Friday that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash but added the dispersed debris field suggested the aircraft had ""hit something before the plane fell.""News of the death of the charismatic Latin Grammy winner, known as ""the Boss"" to her millions of fans, shocked the country Friday. Prominent Brazilians, including football star Neymar, came forward in the wake of the news to share their grief.Mendonça quickly rose to fame in the popular sertanejo country music genre and made her mark by singing about women's empowerment in an environment traditionally dominated by male musicians. She was the most-listened to artist in Brazil on Spotify in 2019 and 2020, according to her PR firm, and had more than 38 million followers on Instagram.Neymar, a close friend of the singer, wrote on Twitter: ""I refuse to believe it, I refuse.""Ronaldo Caiado, governor of Mendonça's home state of Goiás, said her family had confirmed a funeral for the singer would begin around 8 a.m. local time Saturday in an arena in the state capital, Goiânia. Caiado wrote on Twitter that he expects up to 100,000 mourners at her funeral.Caetano Veloso, a septuagenarian stalwart of the Brazilian genre MPB -- Brazilian pop music -- praised her on Twitter as the ""marvelous Mendonça"" and said the news had left him in tears.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the ""entire country"" was in ""shock"" over the news of her death, while Rio de Janeiro Gov. Claudio Castro called her loss a ""tragic accident.""""Young and talented, Marília was the protagonist of a new chapter of Brazilian country music and inspiration for several singers in the segment.

18,Nicaragua's looming election poses two challenges to the rest of the region,"Nicaragua's upcoming election on November 7 is expected to hold no surprises, after strongman president Daniel Ortega spent most of the year tightening his grip on the country. With seven opposition candidates behind bars and thousands of critics abroad to escape the oppressive control of Ortega's police, the septuagenarian leader and his colorful wife, Rosario Murillo, look undisputedly in control of the vote outcome. The biggest question now isn't who will win -- but how the rest of the region will react once Ortega declares victory.                                                                               Democracy has been eroding across Latin America: From north to south, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated a trend of regional caudillos seizing the political stage and working to weaken democratic checks and balances.In February 2020, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele ordered the military to raid parliament to ""spur"" lawmakers to authorize a loan to his government. In August this year, his example was followed by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who organized a military parade in Brasilia just as Congress was debating a Bolsonaro-backed reform of the voting system (the reform did not pass). According to a regional survey of over 20,000 people by polling firm Latinobarometro, less than 50% of Latin Americans polled in 2020 say democracy is preferable to any other form of government and more than one in ten openly advocate for an authoritarian regime.Support for authoritarianism is strongest in younger generations, showed the poll, with 49% of people aged 16-25 saying they either support an authoritarian regime or are indifferent to the form of government.And indifference to democratic government seems particularly acute in Central America, with the majority of poll respondents in the impoverished Northern Triangle nations Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador saying they would be in favor of a non-democratic government ""if it resolves the country's problems.""Two challenges for the regionIn June, former Costa Rican president Laura Chinchilla described a spate of arrests by the Ortega administration as ""the night of the long knives in the tropics,"" while US State Department spokesman Ned Price has said repressive conditions in Nicaragua are simply ""not consistent with credible elections.""But the vote is going ahead anyway. And now having intimidated or locked up all viable political opponents, Ortega's expected reelection in Nicaragua presents two challenges to the rest of the region: Will other leaders speak out against this subversion of democratic processes? And how will the many multilateral systems designed to defend democracy in Latin America -- the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the Organization of American States, and smaller groups like the Pacific Alliance or the Andean Community -- reckon with their failure to prevent Nicaragua's slide toward a dictatorship?While many countries have condemned the arrest of opposition figures in Nicaragua -- and the US has even imposed sanctions -- they may be hesitant to push much further after being burned by their experience with Venezuela in recent years.After a contested election in 2019, dozens of foreign governments chose not to acknowledge strongman Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, favoring instead opposition leader Juan Guaido. But the strategy backfired -- two years later, Maduro retains control of the country and has effectively won his battle against international pressure.""I think the Venezuelan crisis caused a certain caution among the international community over what to do in Nicaragua,"" says Tiziano Breda, a Central American analyst at the International Crisis Group.""After investing so much on Guaidó, and creating this impasse in Venezuela that has not resolved the crisis there, there is less clarity of what an alternative strategy for Nicaragua could be: opposing Ortega, sure, but what is the alternative?"" Breda told CNN.  One likely reason Venezuela's political crisis triggered so much regional reaction is because it went hand-in-hand with a migration crisis: 4.6 million Venezuelans have so far fled the country, according to UNHCR. In contrast, political oppression in Nicaragua has not triggered a similar mass exodus that would force its neighbors to act -- at least not yet.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211102150050-01-nicaragua-election-daniel-ortega-intl-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/americas/nicaragua-election-daniel-ortega-intl/index.html,politics
27,US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it.  Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014. If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.  Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development. ""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said. More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says. ""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region."" The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation. The lost value amounted to $96 million a year. Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society: Heat reduction: Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings, parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up."" Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams. Noise reduction:  Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits. Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says. Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property. Improved human health:  Many studies have found connections between exposure to nature and better mental and physical health. Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies. Doctors are even prescribing walks in nature for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with lower death rates. Wildlife habitat:  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life. Planning for treesNowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways."" Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being."" Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.  ""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""How you can help stop tree loss Protect what you have:  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true."" Prune the dead limbs out of your trees:  If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said. Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice. Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary:  Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow."" Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control. Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

29,How rich people could help save the planet from climate change,"Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change.Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by itBut some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference. Spend wiselyThe buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.    ""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. ""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. ""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.  ""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.Fund climate researchThe wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. ""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. Role models The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions. ""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters. ""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

43,"There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed","Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.No sleepTuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. ""Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,"" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. ""In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,"" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. ""We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,"" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls ""virtual railroads,"" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. ""If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,"" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the ""middle mile,"" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. ""A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,"" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. ""Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,"" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone. TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. ""The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,"" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. ""In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,"" said Lu. ""The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.""

44,A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuries,"Working in a factory or warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The ""Ironhand"" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a ""soft exoskeleton."" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Reducing fatigue""When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,"" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. ""It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.""The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called ""Robo-Glove,"" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. ""Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,"" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.""By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.""  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.""If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,"" says Krajcarski. ""But this is an exciting technology.""This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210423125914-20210423-traders-background-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/12/world/ironhand-exoskeleton-glove-spc-intl/index.html,politics

52,This unique mentorship program helps students with learning differences realize 'their brains are beautiful',"Growing up, David Flink struggled in school -- despite his smarts.He had a hard time focusing in class, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.""There was a calculation made,"" he said. ""I could either be the dumb kid or I could be the bad kid. So, I started acting out.""Flink was often asked to leave the classroom because of the disruptions he caused.""At one point, my desk was literally moved to the hallway,"" he said. ""But then I had this message sent to me that I didn't belong in a classroom.""One in five children in the United States has a learning disability. At the time, Flink didn't realize he was among them, and his struggles left him feeling alone and isolated.It was in a hallway where Flink met his first mentor, the school's janitor. ""He got to know me, and eventually we started playing chess,"" Flink said. ""There was nothing that said he had to take an interest in my life, and he did anyhow. And that saved me.""At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University. When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability. They called the program Eye to Eye.""It was lightning in a bottle,"" Flink said of the program's early days. ""All of a sudden, all this stuff that we thought was really taboo and doesn't sound good -- we discovered they were just words. Under all of that was potential.""Since 1998, Eye to Eye has grown into a nationwide non-profit that pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference.  ""Middle school is actually the predictor of success,"" Flink said. ""It's where kids have the maturity to say, 'Hey, this is how my brain works. And I can ask for that thing.'"" Eye to Eye's curriculum utilizes art as a self-expression tool. Every activity in the 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.""It's incredible to see a classroom of our mentors and mentees,"" Flink said. ""They can be open and be themselves and that stigma is gone."" The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school. ""It's just crazy to me when we think about groups of students who are likely to fail, we don't look at the thing that they're showing up to do, which is learn,"" Flink said. ""This group has the highest dropout rate in our country. We can solve for that.""While Flink enjoys hearing about the academic success Eye to Eye brings to children, there's something more he finds gratifying.  ""When I hear that because they were in Eye to Eye, they now understand somebody else's experience better who's different than them -- this is what we need in America,"" Flink said. ""We have to love each other across our difference.""CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Flink about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: How has the pandemic affected your work? David Flink: When Covid first hit and suddenly we sent kids home, my biggest fear was that the kids who learned differently were going to be the first to suffer because they were already the ones who were suffering in school. So, we took our corps of mentors and we started deploying them virtually. It's taking the same secret sauce that was in person and providing it in a virtual format.CNN: What's special about the relationship between mentor and mentee? Flink: Every mentor and mentee relationship, of course, has its own unique DNA. But the thing that I keep seeing that is similar is, number one, there's this immediate sense of trust. They're different ages and different life experiences, and so why would they get along so well? But there's this immediate sense of trust and understanding that's just magical.The second thing was a surprise for me. The students come to meet in a community -- the mentees are meeting with their mentors and next to them there's another mentee meeting with their mentor. And so, while they may not be working directly together, they are working together in the same room. So just looking around, they feel this sense of sameness and of empowerment.CNN: What is your hope for the kids you're helping? Flink: My hope for the kids in Eye to Eye today is the exact same hope I had 21 years ago when I first stepped into a classroom to mentor. I want them to know that their brains are beautiful. I want them to know that they can achieve anything. I want them to leave feeling like they know how to ask for what they need. And that they can do it. And that's what we give them.Want to get involved?

53,CNN honors 10 men and women for making the world a better place,"These 10 people are making the world a better place and now, they have been named the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2021.They were all nominated by you -- our audience -- and selected by CNN to each receive a $10,000 prize. And now you can vote on who you think should be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.To find out who is named Hero of the Year, you'll have to watch ""The 15th Annual CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute,"" hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa on Sunday, December 12, starting at 8 p.m. ET. CNN Heroes has been spotlighting the impactful work of people across the world since 2007. Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her countryHer cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said. She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means ""gratitude to the earth"" in Spanish.Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her workLynda Doughty: The seal rescuerHer cause:  For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.What inspired her:  Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.""I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life,"" Doughty said.She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.""I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals,"" Doughty said.She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.Read more about Lynda Doughty and her workDavid Flink: Creating a new way to learnHis cause:  David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference. Eye to Eye's 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school.What inspired him: Growing up, Flink had a hard time focusing in school, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia.

Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability.Read more about David Flink and his workDr. Patricia Gordon: Saving women from a preventable diseaseHer cause: Dr. Patricia Gordon operates CureCervicalCancer, which delivers screening, training and supplies to clinics around the world. The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.""That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life,"" Gordon said. ""I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived.""What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.""There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable,"" she said.The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call ""See & Treat,"" screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.Read more about Dr. Patricia Gordon and her workHector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chanceHis cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.  What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.""Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications,"" Guadalupe said. ""Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up.""After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.Read more about Hector Guadalupe and his workMichele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief togetherHer cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.""It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward,"" Neff Hernandez said.What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.""I didn't even know what to do with myself,"" Neff Hernandez said. ""Every single thing about my life changed.""While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.""I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make,"" she said.Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her workZannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.""These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in,"" he said. ""Children ... are not even having this war.""What inspired him: Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.""(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his workShirley Raines: Beauty 2 the StreetzHer cause:  For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.Rain or shine, she sets up ""shop"" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls ""Kings"" and ""Queens."" Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.""I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together,"" Raines said.  Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.""I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together,"" she said.After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Read more about Shirley Raines and her workDr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoodsHer cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.What inspired her:  Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said.Read more about Dr. Ala Stanford and her workMade Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding familiesHis cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.  In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.""I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table,"" he said. ""This concerned me.""Yasa said he wanted to find a way to help people in his community during the pandemic while also addressing the ongoing problem of plastic pollution on Bali's beaches.""I got to thinking, inside the challenge there is an opportunity,"" he said.Read more about Made Janur Yasa and his work",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141114124652-heroes-background-small-169.png,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/29/world/cnn-heroes-top-ten-2021/index.html,politics
58,Death of pregnant woman ignites debate about abortion ban in Poland,"The death of a pregnant Polish woman has reignited debate over abortion in one of Europe's most devoutly Catholic countries, with activists saying she could still be alive if it were not for a near total ban on terminating pregnancies.Tens of thousands of Poles took to the streets to protest in January this year when a Constitutional Tribunal ruling from October 2020 that terminating pregnancies with fetal defects was unconstitutional came into effect, eliminating the most frequently used case for legal abortion.Activists say Izabela, a 30-year-old woman in the 22nd week of pregnancy who her family said died of septic shock after doctors waited for her unborn baby's heart to stop beating, is the first woman to die as a result of the ruling.The government says the ruling was not to blame for her death, rather an error by doctors.Izabela went to hospital in September after her waters broke, her family said. Scans had previously shown numerous defects in the fetus.""The baby weighs 485 grams. For now, thanks to the abortion law, I have to lie down. And there is nothing they can do. They'll wait until it dies or something begins, and if not, I can expect sepsis,"" Izabela said in a text message to her mother, private broadcaster TVN24 reported.When a scan showed the fetus was dead, doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, southern Poland, decided to perform a Caesarean. The family's lawyer, Jolanta Budzowska, said Izabela's heart stopped on the way to the operating theater and she died despite efforts to resuscitate her.""I couldn't believe it, I thought it wasn't true,"" Izabela's mother Barbara told TVN24. ""How could such a thing happen to her in the hospital? After all, she went there for help.""Budzowska has started legal action over the treatment Izabela received, accusing doctors of malpractice, but she also called the death ""a consequence of the verdict"".In a statement on its website, the Pszczyna County Hospital said it shared the pain of all those affected by Izabela's death, especially her family.""It should ... be emphasized that all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland,"" the hospital said.On Friday, the hospital said it had suspended two doctors who were on duty at the time of the death.The Supreme Medical Chamber, which represents Polish doctors, said it was not immediately able to comment.Not one moreWhen the case came to public attention as a result of a tweet from Budzowska, the hashtag #anijednejwiecej or ""not one more"" spread across social media and was taken up by protesters demanding a change to the law.However, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party rejects claims that the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was to blame for Izabela's death, attributing it to a mistake by doctors.""When it comes to the life and health of the mother ... if it is in danger, then terminating the pregnancy is possible and the ruling does not change anything,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday.PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski told Reuters that the case should not be ""instrumentalized and used to limit the right to life, to kill all sick or disabled children.""But activists say the ruling has made doctors scared to terminate pregnancies even when the mother's life is at risk.""Izabela's case clearly shows that the ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal has had a chilling effect on doctors,"" Urszula Grycuk of the Federation for Women and Family Planning told Reuters.""Even a condition that should not be questioned -- the life and health of the mother -- is not always recognized by doctors because they are afraid.""In Ireland, the death of 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar in 2012 after she was refused a termination provoked a national outpouring of grief credited by many as a catalyst for the liberalization of abortion laws.Budzowska told Reuters that a debate similar to the one that took place in Ireland was underway in Poland.""Both Izabela's family and I personally hope that this case ... will lead to a change in the law in Poland,"" she said.Poland's president proposed changing the law last year to make abortions possible in cases where the fetus was not viable. The Law and Justice dominated parliament has yet to debate the bill.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211107090155-poland-abortion-protest-11-06-2021-iza-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/europe/poland-abortion-ban-march-intl/index.html,politics
61,At least 98 killed in Sierra Leone fuel tanker explosion,"At least 98 people died on Friday after a fuel tanker exploded in a suburb of Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, according to authorities in the West African country.Mohamed Lamrane Bah, director of communications for Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), told CNN that several people were also in critical condition following the explosion.Authorities have transferred injured people to hospitals and collected the bodies, and the rescue effort at the scene has ended, Bah added.The explosion occurred after two vehicles collided on the highway while the fuel tanker was about to enter a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel, the NDMA said in a statement posted to Facebook on Saturday afternoon.""Footage and eyewitnesses intimated that while the collision took place, both drivers came out of their vehicles and warned community residents to stay off the scene while trying to address a leakage emanating from the collision,"" the statement said. It added that while that was happening, ""some community members rushed to the scene and took advantage of the leakage to scoop fuel and store it in nearby makeshift structures.""""In the cause of scooping the fuel, there was a major explosion that resulted in the fire disaster that occurred,"" it said.The NDMA immediately visited the scene and coordinated emergency response with partners. Ambulances were assembled to take corpses and those in critical situations to various hospitals in Freetown.There have been 92 people admitted to hospitals within Freetown, the NDMA statement said.Freetown Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr said in a statement on Facebook that she was ""saddened to hear about an explosion along Bai Bureh Road, Wellington, after a truck carrying fuel collided with another truck.""""The video and photo footage making rounds on social media are harrowing,"" Aki-Sawyerr added.""My sympathies go out to the families and loved ones of the victims of the explosion. May the souls of the departed rest in perfect peace.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211106053939-01-sierra-leone-explosion-1106-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/06/africa/sierra-leone-explosion-intl/index.html,politics
62,The search for another Earth across the galaxy heats up,"I've always been a bit dazzled by the fact that, as humans, we truly are made of star stuff. This week, an element found in our teeth was detected for the first time in a galaxy 12 billion light-years away. That means during the early chaotic days of the universe, stars were exploding and releasing key elements from their core into space. Then, those elements ended up on Earth and inside our bodies. Space may seem cold, dark and alien, but it's not as far removed from us as we may think. Astronauts even hosted an out-of-this-world taco party on the International Space Station last week to celebrate and snack on the first chile peppers grown in space. How cool (or hot!) is that? If our future really is out there, at least we'll have a way to spice up our food. And perhaps space isn't so alien after all.Across the universeIt's time to find other planets like Earth and understand if we're truly alone in the universe. That's the consensus of the highly anticipated Astro2020 decadal survey published this week, which acts as a road map for agencies like NASA when planning their missions.Over the next decade, scientists will aim to unlock the secrets of the universe and identify Earth-like planets outside of our solar system to find other habitable worlds. There are over 4,000 known exoplanets across the galaxy, including the intriguing Earth-size planets of the Trappist system. But astronomers need more information to find actual signs of habitability and life.One mission that could help in this search is a large telescope, slated to launch in the 2040s and similar in scale to Hubble, that could seek signatures of life on about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets. Going greenAs for our home planet, all eyes have been on the COP26 climate summit in Scotland as world leaders try to avert a global climate catastrophe. The gap is widening between the impacts of the climate crisis and the world's effort to adapt to them, according to a new United Nations report that will publish during the conference.A historic breakthrough was reached at the summit when 20 countries agreed to end financing for fossil fuel projects abroad in a deal announced Thursday. Curtailing fossil fuels could limit long-term global warming.One way to cut back on emissions? Converting classic cars, like a six-seat Rolls-Royce Phantom and James Bond's favorite Aston Martin DB5, into electric vehicles.We are familyMeet Leti, the small child of an ancient human relative that lived between 236,000 and 335,000 years ago.The skull, from a child that was 4 to 6 years old at the time of death, is the first known to belong to Homo naledi.The fragments of the child's skull were found in an incredibly narrow passage of South Africa's Rising Star cave, where Homo naledi fossils were initially unearthed in 2013.While the discovery of a child fossil can help researchers understand how this enigmatic species developed, they are even more fascinated by how Leti ended up in the cave in the first place.Fossils and fireballsIn South America, intense heat turned the Atacama Desert's sandy soil into vast areas of glass stretching for 46.6 miles (75 kilometers) about 12,000 years ago. Researchers have attempted to figure out what caused this drastic change for years, even questioning if ancient wildfires were the culprit. Within the dark green and black glass fragments scattered across the Chilean desert, scientists have found minerals with an extraterrestrial source. And where there are alien minerals, giant, explosive fireballs are usually to blame.Fantastic creaturesBaby seals know how to get attention -- and not just because they are the adorable puppies of the sea. In fact, baby seals share a rare vocal ability with humans. This adjustment, known as being ""vocally plastic,"" is in response to factors that can otherwise drown out a seal's voice. Clear communication is critical because it allows seals to escape from predators and find mates. Scientists studied wild-born seal pups between 1 and 3 weeks old at a rehab and research center in the Netherlands and watched how they responded to recordings of sea noise. Also, working with precious newborn seals sounds like a sweet dream come true.CuriositiesCheck these out:--  A 300 million-year-old fossil skeleton excavated at Canyonlands National Park in Utah could be a new species. -- Calling all space plumbers.

63,The Dutch are masters at taming water. Climate change is teaching them to just let it flood,"In the spitting rain that is endemic to the Netherlands, Anneke van Lelieveld bundles up in her bright orange cardigan at her home on the New Merwede River, and turns to look out over the wetlands behind her garden.She loves the vista. She loves docking a boat just strides from her vegetable plot. She loves spotting eagles and beavers. But there is a reticence to her joy.""The mixed feeling is that it was my neighbor's land,"" van Lelieveld says. ""I'm sad because I know how sad my neighbor is. Because he was giving up his land.""What used to be her neighbor's farm, walled off from the nearby river that posed a constant threat, is now pockmarked with water. It is flooded, purposefully, to soak up water when the river swells. It's not suitable for farming, but Van Lelieveld is able to live here. A simple small dike keeps her home and some others on the street dry, even if their backyards are not.This is all part of an ambitious climate project aptly called Room for the Rivers.The Dutch have battled for centuries to keep water off the land in their low-lying country, more than a quarter of which lies below sea level.While ""adaptation"" sounds like a dull word in climate talk, the Dutch have been adapting to the whims of water for a long time. Pumps, dikes and giant moveable seawalls protect the country, at least half of which is threatened by floods.Nothing about the Dutch example is perfectly replicable: Its landscape, tradition of political powersharing, and water-aware culture are unique. But there's a lot to be learned.The climate crisis is only intensifying that vulnerability. Erratic weather is no longer a problem for the future -- it's clearly here, in most parts of the world --  nor is it a problem just of extremes, like blazing forest fires and flash floods. It's also a matter of getting organized, as governments and people make life-or-death decisions now for potentially worse threats arriving in an even warmer world.Dutch expertise has come in handy for people running into trouble with water around the world. In the 17th Century, King Charles I asked a Dutchman, Cornelius Vermuyden, to help drain the marshes in England's Cambridgeshire. When New York City was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the US Government turned to the Dutch for help. When the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal, a Dutch company was contracted to get it out.But climate change means that these brute-force methods that have worked for centuries won't always cut it. A dike can only be so large before it collapses under its own weight, and heightening it only increases the risk when it fails.In the 1990s, the Dutch government started to change tack, better understanding that the natural state of bodies of water exist for good reasons. One example is low-lying, uninhabited land next to rivers that could flood and help absorb water when it rains heavily upstream. That meant doing something unusual for the Dutch: knocking down some of the walls that once held back water, and moving people off the land.'This is the result' of climate changeTo understand why the project is so vital, right now, the headwaters of the rivers that empty into the Netherlands offer an insight.Some 300 kilometers (186 miles) up the Rhine River from Van Lelieveld's humble house lies the Ahr, a tributary that snakes through picturesque hills of west German wine country.It was here in July that floodwaters rose higher than they ever had in the collective memory of Dernau, a small town nestled between steep slopes of vineyards.""It's not easy to finds words for it,"" says Lea Kreuzberg, 23, who on July 14 was sitting in her apartment above the winery she runs with her father.In the space of just a few hours, floodwaters spilled into the courtyard, submerged the ground floor, and rose into her apartment. Kreuzberg, her boyfriend, and two winery employees retreated to the building's top floor.""They spent a terrifying night together, preserving phone battery to communicate with Kreuzberg's father, who was on vacation in Austria. The water finally peaked, then slowly subsided. Finally, at 5pm the next day, they were rescued.""In the first days, the rain made me feel very uncomfortable,"" Kreuzberg said, referring to the time immediately after the floods. ""When it started raining a bit more, the emotions came up again and I start crying,"" she added.""When we will go back here, it will not be easy to live here without being afraid.""The human impact of July's flooding was devastating. In the state of Rhineland Palatinate alone, it killed 133 people. In total, 180 were killed in Germany and 39 in Belgium. One victim was never found.Nearly 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain fell in a single 24-hour period from July 14 to 15, according to The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, causing widespread damage not only in Germany and Belgium, but also in France, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Dutch province of Limburg.The region is no stranger to floods. But EUMESTAT said that July's rainfall was ""particularly devastating"" and that those kinds of intense storms ""are becoming more likely with changing climate.""To Franziska Schnitzler, standing in the ruins of her family hotel and restaurant, that connection is clear. The 350-year-old, timber-frame building it once occupied was deemed unsafe and torn down.""We do live with the climate change,"" Schnitzler says. ""And this is the result.""And for young and old alike, climate change is intersecting with a crisis of mental health. In the days after the floods, three people in Dernau took their own lives.""It was the grandma of one of my best friends,"" Schnitzler says. ""One night she woke me up and she said, 'My grandma, my grandma, my grandma.'""""That was so hard, to lose someone after the flood.""A wake-up call for the NetherlandsThe people who have given up their homes and land in the Netherlands did it not primarily for themselves, but for others. They were asked to sacrifice to protect people in cities up- and down-river, for whom floods pose a much more acute threat.It was major flooding from rivers in 1993 and 1995 that served as ""a wake-up call,"" says Hans Brouwer, who for years has managed projects for the Dutch government's Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.""We focused for decades on the sea, and defending us from storm surges,"" he recalls. ""And then we were surprised by our rivers. And in '95 the decision was made to evacuate a quarter of a million people. So that really made an impression.""Those floods coincided with some of the first reports from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ringing the climate alarm bells.""We realized that we can expect even more water from the rivers, and at the same time it would be difficult to get rid of that water because of sea-level rise,"" Brouwer said.Some 15 years ago, Brouwer's colleagues came to Nol Hooijmaijers, a dairy farmer, and told him that that eye-shaped spit of land that he and 17 other families called home would soon need to be turned into a floodplain.""We had been through '93 and '95. So we did think that something would have to be done at some point. What that was, we didn't know,"" Hooijmaijers, now 72, said. ""Then when the government came and said that this area might be used as a floodplain, yeah, that was of course a huge shock.""""We had been convinced that we could stay here and farm for generations.""He and his fellow farmers got together and decided that would ""try to turn a threat into an opportunity.""While some left rather than deal with the heartache, Hooijmaijers, his wife, and seven other families decided to stay. They convinced the government to build enormous, six-meter-high artificial dwelling mounds, or ""terps,"" on which to relocate their farms and houses. The northern dike that had protected their land was in turn lowered, allowing floodwater to spill over the land.Change, 'even when it breaks your heart'The Room for the Rivers project was a monument to planning, foresight, and what can be achieved when government and citizen engage in collective action. Thirty-four projects -- coming in at a total cost of $2.66 billion -- mean that Dutch rivers can now absorb about 25% more water than they could in 1995.During July's enormous rainfall, van Lelieveld watched as the river swelled, picked up speed, and turned brown from silt and debris.""It's then that you can see the function of the region, because we didn't have any issues with high water here,"" she said. ""I hope that people understand that, what I have sacrificed to do that.""Brouwer described a ""paradigm shift"" in which engineers realized ""we don't even always understand how nature acts, but we take nature seriously.""The design for the area in which van Lelieveld lives, he explained, was based on a century-old map -- ""not knowing exactly why it functioned in that time, but having confidence that nature took the right choices.""The project created the wetlands that flooded her former neighbor's farm and are now home to vast flocks of birds. When she goes out in her boat, she thinks of the struggle that the farmer waged to get decent compensation for his land. ""On the one hand, I don't dare to enjoy it, because I also experienced that sadness, and saw what it did to people,"" she said.""But on the other hand, I'm very proud of what we achieved in this region. And that we can also be an example, that it's possible.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211102153937-02-netherlands-flooding-strategy-germany-climate-cop26-intl-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/world/netherlands-flooding-strategy-germany-climate-cop26-intl/index.html,politics
65,A dangerous crisis is brewing in the Balkans. Will the West do anything to stop another war?,"The Balkan state of Bosnia-Herzegovina is on the verge of what analysts warn is its most serious crisis since the end of the Bosnian war in 1995, in which thousands were killed and horrendous acts of ethnic cleansing were committed. The international community's High Representative in Bosnia, Christian Schmidt, warned earlier this week that the US-brokered peace agreement signed at the end of the war is at risk of collapsing unless action is taken to stop Serbian separatists from pushing towards secession.Milorad Dodik, the Serbian leader in Bosnia's three-person presidency, has over time repeatedly threatened to break away from the rest of the country, which has since the war been made up of two autonomous regions linked by a central government. This time, however, he is putting some flesh on the bones by introducing legislation that would divorce Republika Srpska (Serb Republic) from the state's joint institutions like the armed forces and judicial bodies. ""This is tantamount to secession without proclaiming it,"" Schmidt told the UN Security Council, which met this week to reauthorize the longstanding mission of the European Union-led peacekeeping force EUFOR.In a country where ethnic divisions between Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats led to war crimes being committed in recent history, this level of tension is making observers very nervous.""There is no question that this is by far the most dangerous crisis since 1995 and that it could lead to another war,"" said Ismail Cidic, president of the Bosnian Advocacy Center, an independent NGO that advocates for a free, sovereign, democratic and secular Bosnia-Herzegovina.Why is it happening now? Sectarian tensions between the communities have persisted ever since the end of the war and signing of the US-brokered Dayton agreement.The treaty ended the three-and-a-half-year war by dividing the state along ethnic lines, into the Serb Republic and the Federation, which is shared by both Bosniaks and Croats. The two regions are tied together by a three-person presidency, international envoys, and a central government. No peace treaty can erase the murder, systemic rape and other horrors people lived through during the war, but one incident lingers in the memory more than others: the Srebrenica massacre that took place between July 11-22, 1995. Thousands of Muslim men and boys were murdered by Bosnian Serb forces. Their leaders were later convicted of war crimes and the massacre has been recognized as a genocide by the international community. However, not all Serbs are willing to accept this. One such person is Dodik -- who has been particularly irked by the recent introduction of a law by the High Commissioner's office that could hand prison sentences to anyone who denies that genocide was committed.Earlier this year, he said of the law: ""This is the nail in Bosnia's coffin ... The Republika Srpska has no other option but to start the ... dissolution."" How bad could things get?Observers fear that even if Dodik doesn't move towards secession, his actions could be seriously destabilizing and cause violence, forced migration and abject misery for ordinary people. ""Citizens throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina -- including in the entity of Republika Srpska -- fear violence,"" said Arminka Helić, a Bosnian-born politician who is now a member of the British House of Lords and former special advisor to the British foreign secretary. ""A further move towards secession would likely lead to a reaction. There is no way the breakup of Bosnia Herzegovina can be done peacefully.""Heather Staff, an advisor at RAMP Project, an organization specializing in migration policy, warns that ""violent conflict will lead to a refugee crisis, and displaced people -- in the 90s and 2000s we saw people fleeing Bosnia to neighboring countries such as Montenegro.""She says this is a region ""where rhetoric at times has been harsh regarding the treatment of asylum seekers ... how would those fleeing be treated in neighboring countries?""The impact would of course be felt beyond the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina.Jasmin Mujanović, author of the book 'Hunger and Fury: The Crisis of Democracy in the Balkans,' said it would be a ""catastrophe for the European Union and the Atlantic community more broadly, as it would be yet another security crisis in an already extremely volatile southeast of Europe."" He pointed out that with security crises already existing in Ukraine, Belarus, Syria and Afghanistan ""a significant deterioration in the security and stability of Bosnia is something that both the EU and the US can ill afford.""As is so often the case in geopolitics, a poke in the eye for the West provides an opportunity for rivals like Russia and China. A senior EU official told CNN of their concern at how the situation could be exploited. ""We are stuck between a rock and a hard place. The international community cannot be seen to be victimizing the Serbs, as it pushes them and Serbia further into Russia's arms. But the Balkans are on the EU's doorstep. Increased Russian influence in the region gives them another foothold and platform for influence, if they want to destabilize things further.""Who is to blame?Many in the West accept in private that it has thus far failed to step up to the plate and it might now be too late. Multiple sources in the EU, NATO and the wider European diplomatic community expressed regret at the West's historic failure to place sanctions or act otherwise against those fanning the flames in Bosnia-Herzegovina. ""Dodik and his clique of secessionists and genocide deniers have been appeased consistently for 15 years by the international community. He has been talking about -- and moving towards -- secession since 2006,"" said Helic.  Mujanović said that while neighboring Serbia and Russia are the ""primary architects of this crisis,"" he does believe that ""the refusal of the international community -- in particular, the NATO states -- to decisively act to nip this in the bud years ago"" has emboldened Dodik and his supporters. Mujanović pointed specifically at the EU, which he said had been ""extremely underwhelming"" due to its own internal discord, making the bloc ""at this point in many ways a non-factor."" What can be done?""The international community has a clear mandate to protect peace in Bosnia,"" said Cidic. ""Any escalation of violence in Bosnia could harm them tremendously as they cannot afford a Russia-backed conflict, entangled with Chinese and other interests, on NATO's borders.""But will the West do anything? A NATO official told CNN: ""We urge Russia to play a constructive role in the Western Balkans. We regularly see Russia doing the opposite. NATO works to promote stability, security and cooperation in the region. Any outside interference in domestic democratic processes is unacceptable.""Obviously, NATO could only act on the orders of its member states, and there's no indication that anything beyond tough words will come any time soon. The senior EU official said that there is political will to do something more substantial among some EU member states but acknowledges it will be very difficult to get all 27 on board without some major concessions to countries within the bloc on other issues. The UN Security Council can't act without Russia, which earlier this week only voted to keep peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina once the High Representative's name was removed from the text of the resolution, undermining the credibility of that office. However, there is some reason for hope. Mujanović says that EU member states could ""enact unilateral sanctions against"" Dodik and his cronies, which he believes would have some impact. But diplomacy didn't work in the 1990s, and Cidic does not believe it will work now. ""This failed diplomatic approach resulted in over 100,000 perished, and over 1.1 million refugees,"" he said. That harder approach could be sanctions, combined with treating secessionist moves as a European ""security challenge,"" Helic said. ""We have to roll this back. The sooner we do it the better and easier it is. We don't want to wait for years like we did in the 1990s."" It's hard to see the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina getting better in the immediate future. However, with sufficient political will, powerful actors could prevent it from sliding back into violence. The question is whether powerful Western nations are too distracted to pay sufficient attention to a state that isn't at the top of their priority list right now -- and even if they're willing to act, whether they might find they're too late.

79,Russian diplomat found dead on street outside Berlin embassy,"A Russian diplomat found dead on the sidewalk outside the embassy in Berlin last month is believed by German authorities to have been a secret agent for a Russian intelligence agency, Der Spiegel magazine reported Friday. The body of the 35-year-old diplomat was found on the morning of October 19; he apparently fell from an upper floor of the Russian embassy building in the German capital, though it was unclear why he fell or what the cause of death was, Der Spiegel reported. Der Spiegel and investigative site Bellingcat report that the dead diplomat had been accredited as second secretary at the Russian embassy in Berlin since 2019, but German security officials believe he was an undercover officer for Russia's FSB, the internal security and counterintelligence service, and that he was related to a high-ranking FSB officer.The FSB was previously linked by Western intelligence services to the murder of a Georgian exile who was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, Der Spiegel and Bellingcat reported. The Kremlin has denied any link between the killing and the Russian state. The Russian embassy did not agree to an autopsy of the diplomat, and the his diplomatic immunity meant that Germany's public prosecutor could not carry out an investigation, Der Spiegel reported Friday. Russian and German officials acknowledged the death of the diplomat on Friday following the Der Spiegel report. ""A tragic accident with a Russian diplomat occurred on October 19, 2021,"" the Russian embassy said in a statement. ""All the formalities related to sending the diplomat's body to his homeland were promptly settled with the competent law enforcement and medical authorities of Germany in accordance with the current practice.""""We consider the speculation that appeared in a number of Western media in the context of this tragic incident to be absolutely incorrect.""A spokeswoman at the German foreign ministry told CNN the government was aware of the death of the diplomat, but due to ""reasons of personal protection of the persons concerned and their relatives, no further details will be disclosed at this moment.""The death of the diplomat came nearly a year after an investigation by CNN and Bellingcat revealed that an FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny for more than three years before he was poisoned in August 2020 with the lethal nerve agent Novichok.One of the FSB agents was later duped into telling Navalny over the phone that the Novichok had been planted in his underpants -- a detail that emerged when Navalny posed as a member of Russia's National Security Council and called the agent to press him for details of the operation, as was revealed exclusively in another CNN-Bellingcat investigation.

88,300 million-year-old fossil skeleton in Utah could be the first of its kind,"An approximately 300 million-year-old fossil skeleton discovered at Canyonlands National Park in Utah could be the first of its kind, researchers say. The exact species and classification have yet to be determined, but the fossil is a tetrapod -- meaning animal with four legs -- and could be an early ancestor of either reptiles or mammals. Paleontologists have determined the fossil could be anywhere from 295 million to 305 million years old, between the Pennsylvanian and the Permian geologic time periods.""It's a phenomenal specimen. You do not see something like that very often, so it's really significant for that in itself,"" said Adam Marsh, lead paleontologist at Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. ""But what it indicates is that there's probably more fossils out there, especially at Canyonlands, in this really important time interval.""A team of scientists and paleontologists from Petrified Forest, the Natural History Museum of Utah and the University of Southern California helped collect the fossil from Canyonlands. The fossil was found as a complete skeleton, and the bones were in their ""life positions,"" meaning the same position as when the animal was alive. This fossil appears to be an early amniote, which is a land-living vertebrate that lays eggs, according to Adam Huttenlocker, an outside specialist on the team who researches early tetrapod fossils and is an assistant professor at USC. The complete skeleton allows scientists to analyze the evolution of amniotes, in addition to the ancestors of early reptiles and mammals.This area of Canyonlands hasn't produced amniote fossils in the ancient rock formation the fossil was found in, so Huttenlocker said there's a good chance this fossil represents a new species of early amniote.The fossil excavation of a lifetimeA park ranger at Canyonlands reported the fossil around October 2020. After the research permit was processed, the team collected the fossil a year later, on October 23 of this year. Matthew Van Scoyoc said this was the first time he's seen anyone apply for a research permit to extract a fossil in his four years as the research coordinator of the National Park Service's Southeast Utah Group, which includes Canyonlands. He coordinates research and provides permits for these parks, but excavating hasn't been a part of the job -- until now. ""I never thought I'd get to go on a fossil excavation in my life, and that was just really, really cool,"" Van Scoyoc said.The excavation took an entire day, Van Scoyoc said. The team hiked 13 miles roundtrip into the backcountry, extracted the fossil in two pieces and hiked back with a skeleton in their backpacks. (The fossil's original location, Lost Canyon, is designated as a wilderness area by the National Park Service, so no motorized vehicles were allowed.)The fossil is now at the Petrified Forest fossil preparation lab for tests and scans of the skeleton and skull. After scientists determine the species, which could take at least a year, Marsh said the fossil will remain with the National Park Service for further research and museum exhibits.There is a possibility that this fossil is a new species, which is rare -- Marsh said some paleontologists go their entire careers without a discovery of that kind. But even if the fossil turns out to be a known species, Marsh said this finding is still significant for understanding the biodiversity of that time.Fossil specimens from aquatic animals like shark spines are common finds at Canyonlands, especially along the river, but Huttenlocker said this is the first time he has been notified of a land-living vertebrate fossil.""This is a rare, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me,"" Huttenlocker said.'Scraping the surface'The fossil was at risk for erosion from rain and water, which is why Van Scoyoc said they issued the permit. Canyonlands does not have any paleontologists on staff, so they outsourced paleontologists from Petrified Forest, which is known for its fossils. ""Fossils themselves are probably not that rare in Canyonlands. It's just, we haven't looked for them thoroughly,"" Van Scoyoc said. ""What's happening now is we, as the National Park Service, are able to consider them more.""National park sites are full of undiscovered fossils, Marsh said. The collaboration between park staff and researchers from different parks and institutions is integral, he said, to their discovery.""We're just now scraping the surface about nuts-and-bolts paleontology,"" Marsh said.You can channel your inner paleontologist next time you're at a national park. Marsh said if you think you see a fossil -- don't try excavating it yourself -- send a picture and location to park staff.""This is exactly how we find things that we don't know about otherwise, because we're not always able to get out to certain areas all the time,"" Marsh said. ""It's helpful for folks to let us know what they see.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/world/fossil-skeleton-discovered-canyonlands-scn/index.html,politics
93,Nicaragua's looming election poses two challenges to the rest of the region,"Nicaragua's upcoming election on November 7 is expected to hold no surprises, after strongman president Daniel Ortega spent most of the year tightening his grip on the country. With seven opposition candidates behind bars and thousands of critics abroad to escape the oppressive control of Ortega's police, the septuagenarian leader and his colorful wife, Rosario Murillo, look undisputedly in control of the vote outcome. The biggest question now isn't who will win -- but how the rest of the region will react once Ortega declares victory.                                                                               Democracy has been eroding across Latin America: From north to south, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated a trend of regional caudillos seizing the political stage and working to weaken democratic checks and balances.In February 2020, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele ordered the military to raid parliament to ""spur"" lawmakers to authorize a loan to his government. In August this year, his example was followed by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who organized a military parade in Brasilia just as Congress was debating a Bolsonaro-backed reform of the voting system (the reform did not pass). According to a regional survey of over 20,000 people by polling firm Latinobarometro, less than 50% of Latin Americans polled in 2020 say democracy is preferable to any other form of government and more than one in ten openly advocate for an authoritarian regime.Support for authoritarianism is strongest in younger generations, showed the poll, with 49% of people aged 16-25 saying they either support an authoritarian regime or are indifferent to the form of government.And indifference to democratic government seems particularly acute in Central America, with the majority of poll respondents in the impoverished Northern Triangle nations Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador saying they would be in favor of a non-democratic government ""if it resolves the country's problems.""Two challenges for the regionIn June, former Costa Rican president Laura Chinchilla described a spate of arrests by the Ortega administration as ""the night of the long knives in the tropics,"" while US State Department spokesman Ned Price has said repressive conditions in Nicaragua are simply ""not consistent with credible elections.""But the vote is going ahead anyway. And now having intimidated or locked up all viable political opponents, Ortega's expected reelection in Nicaragua presents two challenges to the rest of the region: Will other leaders speak out against this subversion of democratic processes? And how will the many multilateral systems designed to defend democracy in Latin America -- the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the Organization of American States, and smaller groups like the Pacific Alliance or the Andean Community -- reckon with their failure to prevent Nicaragua's slide toward a dictatorship?While many countries have condemned the arrest of opposition figures in Nicaragua -- and the US has even imposed sanctions -- they may be hesitant to push much further after being burned by their experience with Venezuela in recent years.After a contested election in 2019, dozens of foreign governments chose not to acknowledge strongman Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, favoring instead opposition leader Juan Guaido. But the strategy backfired -- two years later, Maduro retains control of the country and has effectively won his battle against international pressure.""I think the Venezuelan crisis caused a certain caution among the international community over what to do in Nicaragua,"" says Tiziano Breda, a Central American analyst at the International Crisis Group.""After investing so much on Guaidó, and creating this impasse in Venezuela that has not resolved the crisis there, there is less clarity of what an alternative strategy for Nicaragua could be: opposing Ortega, sure, but what is the alternative?"" Breda told CNN.  One likely reason Venezuela's political crisis triggered so much regional reaction is because it went hand-in-hand with a migration crisis: 4.6 million Venezuelans have so far fled the country, according to UNHCR. In contrast, political oppression in Nicaragua has not triggered a similar mass exodus that would force its neighbors to act -- at least not yet.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211102150050-01-nicaragua-election-daniel-ortega-intl-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/americas/nicaragua-election-daniel-ortega-intl/index.html,politics
98,From Nobel laureate to global pariah: How the world got Abiy Ahmed and Ethiopia so wrong,"​​""Abiy, Abiy,"" the crowd chanted, waving Ethiopia's tricolor flag and cheering as the country's new prime minister, dressed in a white blazer with gold trim and smiling broadly, waved to a packed basketball arena at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, part of a whirlwind three-city tour of the United States to woo the diaspora. It was July 2018, just three months after Abiy Ahmed had been appointed leader of Africa's second-most populous country, and his star was rising both at home and abroad. Excitement was surging into an almost religious fervor around the young politician, who promised to bring peace, prosperity and reconciliation to a troubled corner of Africa and a nation on the brink of crisis.     But even in those early, optimistic days of Abiy's premiership, as he kickstarted a flurry of ambitious reforms -- freeing thousands of political prisoners, lifting restrictions on the press, welcoming back exiles and banned opposition parties, appointing women to positions in his cabinet, opening up the country's tightly-controlled economy to new investment and negotiating peace with neighboring Eritrea -- Berhane Kidanemariam had his doubts. The Ethiopian diplomat has known the prime minister for almost 20 years, forging a friendship when he worked for the governing coalition's communications team and, later, as CEO of two state-run news organizations, while Abiy was in military intelligence and then heading Ethiopia's cybersecurity agency, INSA. Before working for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kidanemariam ran the country's national broadcaster, the EBC, and he said Abiy sat on its board of directors. In a recent phone interview, Kidanemariam said he, like many Ethiopians, had hoped Abiy could transform the nation's fractious politics and usher in genuine democratic change. But he struggled to square his understanding of the man he'd first met in 2004 -- who he described as power-hungry intelligence officer obsessed by fame and fortune -- with the portrait emerging of a visionary peacemaker from humble beginnings. In 2018, Kidanemariam was serving as Ethiopia's consul general in Los Angeles and said he helped organize Abiy's visit.   When Kidanemariam, who is from Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, approached the dais to introduce his longtime friend and colleague to the crowd, he said he was greeted with heckles from members of the audience: ""Get out of the podium Tigrayan, get out of the podium Woyane,"" and other ethnic slurs. He expected Abiy, who preached a political philosophy of inclusion, to chide the crowd, but he said nothing. Later, over lunch, when Kidanemariam asked why, he said Abiy told him: ""There was nothing to correct.""  ""One of the ironies of a prime minister who came to office promising unity is that he has deliberately exacerbated hatred between different groups,"" Kidanemariam wrote in an open letter in March, announcing that he was quitting his post as the deputy chief of mission at the Ethiopian embassy in Washington, DC, in protest over Abiy's monthslong war in Tigray, which has spurred a refugee crisis, atrocities and famine. Kidanemariam said to CNN he believed Abiy's focus had never been about ""reform or democracy or human rights or freedom of the press. It is simply consolidating power for himself, and getting money out of it ... We may call it authoritarianism or dictatorship, but he is really getting to be a king.""""By the way,"" he added, ""the problem is not only for Tigrayans. It's for all Ethiopians. Everybody is suffering everywhere.""In an email to CNN, Abiy's spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, described Kidanemariam's characterization of the prime minister as ""baseless"" and a ""reflection.""'The epitome of hell'Much has changed since Abiy accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in November 2019, telling an audience in Oslo, Norway, that ""war is the epitome of hell.""  In less than two years, Abiy has gone from darling of the international community to pariah, condemned for his role in presiding over a protracted civil war that, by many accounts, bears the hallmarks of genocide and has the potential to destabilize the wider Horn of Africa region. The 45-year-old's fall from grace has confounded many observers, who wonder how they could have gotten him so wrong. But diplomats, analysts, independent Ethiopian journalists, acquaintances and others who have followed his career closely say that even at the height of ""Abiymania,"" there were warning signs. Critics say that by blessing Abiy with an array of international endorsements, the West not only failed to see -- or willfully ignored -- those signals, but gave him a blank check and then turned a blind eye. ""Soon after Abiy was crowned with that Nobel Peace Prize, he lost an appetite in pursuing domestic reform,"" Tsedale Lemma, founder and editor-in-chief of Addis Standard, an independent monthly news magazine based in Ethiopia, told CNN on a Skype call. ""He considered it a blanket pass to do as he wishes."" The war in Tigray is not the first time he's used that pass, she said, adding that since Abiy came to power on the platform of unifying Ethiopia's people and in its state, he has ruthlessly consolidated control and alienated critical regional players.Lemma has covered Abiy's rise for the Addis Standard -- which was briefly suspended by Ethiopia's media regulator in July -- and was an early critic of his government when few were sounding the alarm. Days after Abiy was awarded the Nobel Prize, she wrote an editorial warning that the initiatives he had been recognized for -- the peace process with Eritrea and political reforms in Ethiopia -- had sidelined a key stakeholder, the Tigray People's Liberation Front, and were in serious jeopardy.    The TPLF had governed Ethiopia with an iron grip for decades, overseeing a period of stability and economic growth at the cost of basic civil and political rights. The party's authoritarian rule provoked a popular uprising that ultimately forced Abiy's predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, to resign. Abiy was appointed by the ruling class to bring change, without upending the old political order. But almost as soon as he came to power, Abiy announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that the TPLF had founded -- the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front, or EPRDF, which was composed of four parties -- into a single, new Prosperity Party, ostracizing the TPLF in the process.  Abiy's appointment had been intended to quell tensions. Instead, his drive for a new pan-Ethiopian political party sparked fears in some regions that the country's federal system, which guarantees significant autonomy to ethnically-defined states, such as Tigray, was under threat.The Tigrayans weren't the only ones who were worried. In Abiy's home region, Oromia, and other administrative zones, people began to demand self-rule. Soon, the government began backsliding into the authoritarian practices Abiy had once renounced: Violent crackdowns on protesters, the jailing of journalists and opposition politicians, and twice postponing elections.Ahmed Soliman, a research fellow at Chatham House and an expert on the Horn of Africa, said Abiy's reform plan also increased expectations among constituencies with conflicting agendas, further heightening tensions. ""Abiy and his government have rightly been blamed for implementing uneven reforms and for insecurity increasing throughout the country, but to an extent, some of that was inherited. These simmering ethnic and political divisions that exist in the country have very deep roots,"" he said. Tensions reached a boiling point last September, when the Tigrayans defied Abiy by holding a vote which had been delayed due to the pandemic, setting off a tit-for-tat series of recriminations that spilled into open conflict in November 2020.  This July, in the midst of the war, Abiy and his party won a landslide victory in a general election that was boycotted by opposition parties, marred by logistical issues and excluded many voters, including all those in Tigray -- a crushing disappointment to many who had high hopes that the democratic transition Abiy promised three years ago would be realized.   ""He sees himself as a Messiah, as chosen, as someone who's destined to 'Make Ethiopia Great Again,' but this country is collapsing,"" Lemma said, adding that the international community's folly was falling for the picture Abiy painted of himself -- ""a post-ethnic, contemporary capitalist"" -- in their desperation for a dazzling success story. 'A monumental failure of analysis'Still, many Ethiopians are reluctant to lay the blame for the country's unravelling at Abiy's feet. Ahead of the election in June, residents in Addis Ababa told CNN they felt Abiy had inherited a mess from the previous regime and had always faced an uphill battle pushing reforms forward -- an assessment shared by some regional experts.   ""Lots of people were hopeful that the liberalizing changes, after those years of anti-government protests and all of the state violence in response, [...] marked a moment where Ethiopia would start to conduct its politics more peacefully. But that thinking glossed over some of the major problems and contradictions in Ethiopia,"" said William Davison, senior Ethiopia analyst with the International Crisis Group.  ""There was always a massive challenge ahead for Abiy, and for everyone. Just the promise of a more pluralistic political system did nothing necessarily to resolve the clashing nationalisms, opposing visions, and bitter political rivalries."" In recent months, Abiy has tried to dodge international condemnation by pledging to protect civilians, open up humanitarian access to stave off famine and kick out Eritrean troops, who have supported Ethiopian forces in the conflict and stand accused of some of the most horrifying of the many atrocities in Tigray -- pledges that American officials say he has not delivered on. After the United States issued sanctions in May, Ethiopia's foreign ministry accused it of meddling in the country's internal affairs and misunderstanding the significant challenges on the ground.  As the tide of international opinion has turned against Abiy, the prime minister's office has maintained he is not concerned about his deteriorating reputation; his supporters have increasingly blamed the West for the crisis unfolding in the country. ""The prime minister need not be a darling of the west, east, south or north,"" Abiy's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum told reporters in June. ""It is sufficient that he stands for the people of Ethiopia and the development of the nation."" But it is difficult to reconcile the government's narrative with reality. Setting to one side the staggering loss of life and destruction inside Tigray, the war has eroded Abiy's aggressive development plans and derailed the country's economic trajectory, experts say. Ethiopia's economy had grown at nearly 10% for the last decade, before slowing in 2020, dragged down by a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic, debt and conflict. The war has also drained national coffers, decimated a large slice of the country's industry and eroded its reputation among foreign investors and financial institutions.  ""From where I sit, I think there was a monumental failure of analysis, internationally,"" Rashid Abdi, a Kenya-based analyst and researcher who specializes in the Horn of Africa, said, including himself in that group. ""I think people failed to apprehend the complex nature of Ethiopia's transition, especially they failed to appreciate also the complex side of Abiy, that he was not all this sunny, smiling guy. That beneath was a much more calculating, and even Machiavellian figure, who eventually will I think push the country towards a much more dangerous path."" ""We should have begun to take notice of some of the red flags quite quickly. A lot of complacency is what got us here,"" he added.The seventh king of EthiopiaDuring his inaugural address to parliament in 2018, Abiy made a point of thanking his mother, a Christian from the Amhara region, who he said had told him at the age of seven that, despite his modest background, he would one day be the seventh king of Ethiopia. The remark was met with a round of laughter from his cabinet members, but Abiy's belief in his mother's prophecy was no joke. ""In the initial stages of the war, actually, he spoke openly about how this was God's plan, and that this was a kind of divine mission for him. This is a man who early in the morning, instead of meeting his top advisors, would meet with some of his spiritual advisers, these are pastors who are very powerful now in a sort of 'kitchen cabinet,'"" Abdi said. But the most glaring of warning signs, by many accounts, was Abiy's surprise allegiance with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, for which he ultimately won the Nobel Prize. Abiy's critics say that what cemented his status as a peacemaker on the world stage was based on a farce, and that the alignment with Eritrea was yet another effort to consolidate his power, paving the way for the two sides to wage war against their mutual enemy, the TPLF. Soon after the Eritrea-Ethiopia border reopened in 2018, reuniting families after 20 years, it closed again. Three years on, Eritrean troops are operating with impunity in Tigray, and there is little sign of a durable peace. In response, Abiy's spokeswoman rejected this assertion, calling it a ""toxic narrative.""Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor of governance and migration at the European University Institute, who was skeptical of the peace deal early on -- a deeply unpopular view at the time -- believes the Nobel Committee's endorsement of Abiy has contributed to the current conflict.  ""I am of the strongest opinion that the Nobel Prize Committee is responsible for what is happening in Ethiopia, at least partially. They had reliable information; many experts sounded their early warning,"" Mehari, who is from Tigray, told CNN.""The Committee was basing its decision on a peace deal that we flagged for a false start, a peace that is not achieved and perhaps also unachievable and an agreement that was not meant for peace but actually for war. What he [Abiy] did with Isaias was not meant to bring peace. He knew that, Isaias knew that. They were working, basically, to execute a war, to sandwich Tigray from South and North carefully by ostracizing one political party first."" The most palpable and lasting impact of the award, according to several analysts and observers, was a chilling effect on any criticism of Abiy. The persona he cultivated, cemented in part through his many early accolades -- being named African of the Year in 2018, one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, and one of Foreign Policy's 100 Global Thinkers in 2019 -- captivated the imagination of Ethiopians, the country's large diaspora and the world. Many now feel betrayed, having lost any optimism about the future of the country, but others are still intent on retaining that glittering image of Abiy, reluctant to see the writing on the wall. ""By the time the war started in November, the international community was extremely committed to the idea of Abiy Ahmed as a reformer still, and they didn't want to give up on that,"" said Goitom Gebreluel, a Horn of Africa researcher from Tigray, who was in Addis Ababa at the start of the conflict.""I had meetings with various diplomats before the war and it was obvious that the war was coming, and what they were saying was, 'you know, he still has this project, we have to let him realize his political vision,'"" he said. ""To this day, I think not everyone is convinced that this is an autocrat."" Now, with Ethiopia facing a ""man-made"" famine and a war apparently without end, Abiy stands alone, largely isolated from the international community and with a shrinking cadre of allies.   Abiy's early advocates and supporters say he not only misled the world, but his own people -- and they are now paying a steep price.In his open letter announcing he was leaving his post, Kidanemariam wrote of Abiy: ""Instead of fulfilling his initial promise, he has led Ethiopia down a dark path toward destruction and disintegration.""""Like so many others who thought the prime minister had the potential to lead Ethiopia to a bright future, I am filled with despair and anguish at the direction he is taking our country.""This story has been updated to correct the spelling of William Davison's name.

99,Lost species appear alive again in 'The Zoo of Extinct Animals',"Thought to be extinct, the baiji dolphin no longer swims in the Yangtze River in eastern China -- but now, you could find it swimming in your living room. Along with other extinct animals, it is being brought back to life as an augmented reality experience.""The Zoo of Extinct Animals"" is a project started in 2020 by creative director Sebastian Koseda that allows you to observe and interact with 3D representations of extinct wildlife in your own environment, through a Snapchat lens. You can watch the dolphin twirl around in water and make it move around you. A carrier bag can also be seen floating around, suggestive of the plastic waste that has infiltrated its habitat.The animals Koseda is featuring have all already gone extinct in the last 20 years due to human activity. Through the project, he aims to ""raise awareness and show what we've already lost as a call to action -- to make a change.""Read: 'Unseen Empire' turns a huge wildlife camera trap study into a game""Generally, the feedback is like: 'Oh my god, wow, that's beautiful. It's a dolphin swimming in the living room,'"" says 32-year-old Koseda, who is based in London. ""And then: 'Oh god, it's extinct. That's really sad'. So, it hits home. It's like: 'Oh, I'll never be able to see that in real life.'""Because it's out of sight, it's kind of out of mind ... that these animals are going extinct in places that we might not see, like in the Yangtze River,"" he adds.  ""It's still happening and it's still due to human interaction, human disruption (and) pollution.""Wildlife is vanishingThe baiji, nicknamed the ""Goddess of the Yangtze,"" is a type of river dolphin that was native to the Yangtze River and the neighboring Qiantang River. It was declared functionally extinct in 2006, with the last verified sighting being of a pregnant female in November 2001. The main cause of its extinction is thought to be habitat degradation and the level to which it was being unintentionally caught by local fisheries. All over the world, wildlife numbers are in decline. Nearly two-thirds of the world's wildlife population has been lost over the past 50 years, according to a recent WWF report, and there are currently more than 38,500 species threatened with extinction, including 41% of amphibians, 37% of sharks and rays, 26% of mammals and 14% of birds.Koseda's project will initially focus on five recently extinct animals: the baiji dolphin, the Pyrenean ibex, the West African black rhino, the Formosan clouded leopard and the Caribbean monk seal. The lenses for the dolphin and ibex have already been released, and Koseda and his team are currently working on the rhino, which they hope to complete within the next six months.Read: Fake 'decoy' eggs are being used to track turtle poachingThey are working with researchers at University College London to help develop the models for the animals. They first have to find photographs and then create base 3D models, which they try to match as closely to the photographs as possible.""That takes the most time because you're essentially building a skeleton,"" adds Koseda. ""Imagine a puppet and it has points that move the most. You would essentially be creating that for the animal and then animating so it seems as lifelike as possible.""Koseda is not the only one using technology to visualize extinct creatures. France-based SAOLA Studio has teamed up with the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, using augmented reality to revive 11 species that are extinct or close to extinction, in a project called ""Revivre."" In 2016, Google Arts & Culture partnered with more than 50 natural history institutions to create virtual reality dinosaur experiences. Koseda, who runs his own design studio, Studio Koseda, says he only began to focus on his own projects in the last two years and ""wanted the first few projects to be around environmental issues."" His idea for ""The Zoo of Extinct Animals"" came from conversations with his brother about whether or not nature was healing itself during lockdown. Koseda says: ""It did just raise some questions and I think this is a way of exploring that narrative further and seeing where it can go.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180621105208-going-green-background-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/world/zoo-extinct-animals-augmented-reality-spc-intl-scn/index.html,politics
110,Jill Biden pays tribute to one of America's most iconic first ladies,"As the season changed from summer to fall, first lady Jill Biden has found a spot to sit outside at the White House to grade her students' essays. ""On these cool afternoons, I like to go to the Jackie Kennedy garden,"" Biden said Thursday night at a gala to honor the 60th anniversary of the White House Historical Association. Her nod to one of the most iconic first ladies was a fitting tribute to the association's founder, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in whose namesake patch of green the current first lady enjoys taking in ""the burgundy oaks and maples blazing over the grounds,"" she said. The dinner was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, a location that is also an homage to Kennedy, the White House Historical Association President Stewart McLaurin told CNN. ""She was helpful in getting the Temple of Dendur given as a gift (to the Met) from Egypt after the United States helped save it from being flooded by the Aswan Dam,"" he said, referring to a famous ancient artifact housed at the Met that was annually drowned by floods created by an Egyptian dam built in the early 20th century. ""And she also facilitated having (Leonardo da Vinci's) the Mona Lisa there from Paris."" It was Kennedy's dream to have the White House reflect America's own icons and, in 1961, she established the association -- a privately funded, nonprofit organization that is not politically affiliated. At the gala dinner, Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, gave remarks, recounting a letter her mother sent to her close friend Bunny Mellon -- who would later become the designer of the White House Rose Garden -- the day after the presidential election. ""The most terrible thing has happened,"" Kennedy wrote to Mellon. ""Jack has won. We have to move into the White House. How dreary. All those curtains."" In time, Kennedy would become a champion of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- perhaps her most important legacy being the association that preserves America's house.Curating the executive mansionThe White House Historical Association very much remains the keeper of the White House, its artifacts and objects, symbols of grandeur and its ability to be both home to the leader of the free world and a museum of American history open to the public. The association also supports myriad educational and informational programs and has overseen several books on topics ranging from White House china services to the architecture of the building. Since Kennedy's founding, the White House Historical Association has worked in concert with 12 first ladies, many of whom take up the banner of preservation from her predecessor. The White House Historical Association does not just protect and preserve older items already in the collection, it also works to purchase items that have either historical value, or more modern necessity.""Most projects we undertake, particularly major acquisitions, require the support of -- or the ideas of -- each first lady,"" says McLaurin, who has worked during his tenure with Biden, Melania Trump and Michelle Obama. ""We are just beginning our work with the Bidens and I'm sure they will undertake important projects as all others have."" Asked which first lady worked most often ""in the trenches"" with the White House Historical Association, McLaurin pointed to Pat Nixon, ""perhaps the one most unappreciated,"" he said. ""We acquired more for the White House collection during that presidency than any other,"" he added. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the White House has not been open to the public as much as it was before the virus took hold, but McLaurin says the association has still affirmed its support for $1 million in non-taxpayer funding for annual maintenance of the White House collection and upkeep of the public rooms to museum standard. A million dollars per year is about average for these sorts of things, he says, but the funding would be increased if there is a large acquisition for the collection or the undertaking of a major refurbishment or renovation project. In 2020, for example, during Melania Trump's tenure, the White House Historical Association purchased a sculpture by Isamu Noguchi -- entitled ""Floor Frame"" -- that was installed at the east end of the Rose Garden. A representative for the association confirmed to CNN at the time that the Noguchi sculpture was purchased at auction for $125,000. 'We're beginning to feel at home'The history of the building hangs heavy within its walls, Biden said Thursday.""Room by room, in marble mantles and timeless portraits, we can trace the steps of the women and men who walked the White House floors -- whose decisions rippled across the world,"" the first lady said in her Thursday remarks to donors and supporters at the gala. ""And yet, in the shadows and slants of light, we can imagine those intimate moments that affected only those who felt them. The letters written in sitting room corners. The tumbling first steps of a grandchild or leisurely games of fetch with dogs on the South lawn. The soft sounds of bedtime stories, floating down the hall."" Biden noted her family has taken advantage of living at the White House to celebrate private moments, including a granddaughters' college graduation in the Blue Room and the 40th birthday in June of her daughter, Ashley Biden, in the Rose Garden. There are rumblings there will also be a Biden family White House wedding at some point in the next year -- 27-year-old Naomi Biden got engaged in September. The first lady added she had picked out a swing set to be placed on the grounds for her youngest grandson, not yet two years old. ""We're beginning to feel at home -- like so many families before us,"" said Biden, who noted how crucial it is that what is inside the White House is much more than furniture and paintings. Biden said she is still overwhelmed each day by the idea that she lives in such an important place, and at times contemplates the balance of it being where she resides and where history lives. ""I think about all the women who came before me -- and all the women and, yes, men who will take my place. I think about how we shape this American symbol -- this museum, this home.""

114,White House chief of staff 'confident' Biden's administration's vaccine mandate for private businesses will be upheld,"White House chief of staff Ron Klain said he was confident the courts will uphold the validity of the Biden administration's new vaccine rules that apply to private businesses with 100 or more employees, certain health care workers and federal contractors, after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the requirements on Saturday.""I'm quite confident that when this finally gets fully adjudicated, not just a temporary order, the validity of this requirement will be upheld,"" Klain told NBC's Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press."" ""It's common sense ... If OSHA can tell people to wear a hard hat on the job, to be careful around chemicals, it can put in place these simple measures to keep our workers safe.""In the brief order, a three-judge panel on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said that the petitioners in the case -- Republican-led states and private businesses -- ""give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate,"" giving the federal government until 5 p.m., Monday to respond.On Sunday, Klain predicted that the case will be ""well litigated,"" before January 4 when the Biden administration announced the rule will take effect.""I'm not sure it really has much practical effect in the short run,"" Klain said, pointing to the numerous cases already brought against vaccine requirements.""These vaccine requirements have been litigated up and down the courts all over the country. State requirements for example, one in Maine.

115,2021 shows Republicans shouldn't fear high voter turnout,"The Republican Party did very well on Tuesday. Beyond its win in the Virginia gubernatorial election, it came quite close to capturing the New Jersey governor's mansion. And the GOP did it in a way that might scare some Democrats: higher voter turnout. At least in this era, Republicans don't seem to have much to fear from high turnout -- a turnout, amazingly, that came without former President Donald Trump in the White House.Voter turnout in New Jersey and Virginia blasted past what these states saw four years ago. With more votes to be counted, more than 2.5 million New Jersey voters cast a ballot this year compared to 2.1 million in 2017. In Virginia, about 3.3 million votes were cast, compared with 2.6 million in 2017. Both states had the highest numbers of votes cast in a gubernatorial election in those states on record. New Jersey did so despite what many thought would be an uncompetitive affair. Virginia, meanwhile, crushed a record that was just set in 2017.The fact that turnout was even higher than four years ago was a bit of a surprise. Turnout in recent years surged with Trump involved in politics. Without him in the White House, it wasn't far-fetched to imagine that turnout would drop. If anything, Trump not being president may have motivated more Republicans to come out and vote. In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin earned nearly 500,000 more votes than Ed Gillespie did four years ago. By comparison, Democrat Terry McAuliffe won nearly 200,000 votes more than Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam did in 2017. When you break it down by county, turnout rose by about 32% in the counties Youngkin won. It was up half that (16%) in the counties McAuliffe took. Likewise, in New Jersey, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has already earned many more votes this year than he did in 2017. The reason the race was tight was because Republican Jack Ciattarelli has over 300,000 more votes than Republican Kim Guadagno got in 2017. The point here is that higher turnout doesn't necessarily benefit only Democrats. That's something we saw in the 2020 election, too. This was the election that had the highest percentage of the voter-eligible population come out in over 100 years. Using the Pew Research Center's validated voter survey, we can examine voters who decided to cast a ballot in 2020 after not voting in 2016. Specifically, we'll look at all voters who were not in the youngest age category to ensure that they were of eligible age to vote in 2016. Of those who voted in 2020 but not in 2016, Trump won those age 30 and older by 3 points. This made this group slightly more Republican than the age 30 and older group who have a record of voting in both elections. Biden won those by 2 points. These results are within the margin of error of each other, but it is consistent with the idea that the new voters who could cast a ballot in both elections were not more Democratic than the electorate as a whole.This shouldn't be too surprising. The age 30 and older group that voted in both elections were 15 points more likely to have a college degree. Among Whites, they were 17 points more likely. Education, of course, is a key divide in politics today, especially among Whites. College-educated voters are far more likely to vote Democratic. This means that the infrequent voters are coming from the segment of the educational divide that is less friendly to Democrats. Going forward, it seems quite plausible that voter turnout is going to stay high. Our CNN/SSRS poll completed in early September showed that 48% of registered voters were extremely or very enthusiastic to vote in next year's midterm elections. That's the highest percentage this early for any midterm since CNN started asking the question during the 2010 cycle. The high percentage of enthusiastic voters was one of the first early tips that 2020 would have record turnout. And perhaps in-line with everything so far, voters who said they were the most enthusiastic for 2022 were more likely to say they would be voting Republican than voting Democratic. It's possible that 2022, like 2021, could be another election with record turnout where Republicans do well.

117,Biden says his plans are working after October jobs report beats expectations,"President Joe Biden touted the progress the US is making in recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, and cited his policies as the reason, after the jobs recovery gathered some steam last month and employers added 531,000 positions in October. ""America is getting back to work. Our economy is starting to work for more Americans,"" Biden said, speaking from the White House. The better-than-expected report marked a possible turning point after two months of sluggish job gains that were chalked up to the Delta variant of Covid-19 spreading throughout the nation. The unemployment rate in October also fell to 4.6%, which is the lowest level since the economic recovery started in May 2020.It was very welcome news for the President and Democrats, who are still reeling from a gubernatorial defeat in Virginia and a closer-than-expected race in New Jersey this week. The political shocks raised serious concerns for Democrats over how their party would fare in the 2022 midterm elections and how Biden's presidency is being assessed by voters. ""This did not happen by accident or 'just because,' "" Biden said, pointing to the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill he signed into law earlier this year. ""We laid the foundation for this recovery with my American Rescue Plan that Congress passed at the beginning of my term. It put money in working families' pockets, it gave families with kids a tax cut each month, it helped keep small businesses going in the dark days earlier this year and it provided the resources to launch one of the fastest mass vaccination programs ever.""Biden -- whose approval rating last month hit the lowest level of his administration -- on Friday seized the opportunity to make the case his administration's response to the pandemic has been working. In particular, the jobs numbers helped boster the President's argument that vaccine mandates will help with the economic recovery. Biden's new vaccine mandate for businesses with 100 or more employees is being fought by Republican leaders throughout the country. There are currently 24 states that have sued or have formally threatened to sue the Biden administration over the mandate. ""Beating Covid-19 remains one of the most important ways to strengthen our economy -- not just save lives, but strengthen our economy. We're making progress,"" the President said.""That's good for our health, but it's also good for our economy,"" he added. ""Now vaccinated workers are going back to work. Vaccinated shoppers are going back to stores. And with the launch of the vaccine for kids ages 5 through 11 this week, we can make sure more vaccinated children can stay in school.""Biden also referenced the new Pfizer experimental pill to treat Covid-19 infections. An interim analysis -- done before the trial was scheduled to end -- showed an 89% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19 if given the drug within the first three days of symptom onset, Pfizer said earlier Friday.Still, the President said ""there's a lot more to be done.""""We still have to tackle the costs that American families are facing, but this recovery is faster, stronger, and fair and wider than almost anyone could have predicted,"" Biden said. The President said he wants to make sure the recovery ""is fully felt,"" and that Americans see the progress ""in their lives, bank accounts, in their hopes and expectations, for tomorrow is better than today.""The President ramped up the pressure on Capitol Hill and called on the House to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the massive climate and social safety net bill immediately. The political loss in Virginia caused panic among Democrats on the Hill, who appear to agree action needs to be taken on the legislation soon. ""I'm asking every House member, member of the House of Representatives, to vote yes on both these bills right now. Send the infrastructure bill to my desk. Send the Build Back Better bill to the Senate,"" Biden said. This story has been updated with additional information.

119,"Republican Ed Durr will defeat New Jersey's Senate president, CNN projects","Ed Durr, a Republican who has never held elective office and is coming under fire for indicating support for QAnon and expressing Islamophobia in old tweets, will oust a powerful Democrat from New Jersey's state Senate District 3.CNN projected Friday that Durr, who spent two decades as a commercial truck driver and decided to run for the seat when he was denied a concealed carry permit for a gun, will defeat longtime state Senate President Steve Sweeney.Sweeney, the longest-tenured state Senate leader in New Jersey history, had been considered the favorite to win the South Jersey seat he was first elected to in 2001.His ouster at the hands of a Republican who, along with the two other GOP candidates on his slate, spent -- as of 11 days before the election -- fewer than $2,500, underscores the depth of the Election Day voter revolt against leading Democrats. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who was expected to easily win a second term, squeaked by his GOP challenger, Jack Ciattarelli, by only about two percentage points.Asked during a Fox News interview the night after the election what his priority was when he arrived at the state Capitol, Durr promised to be a ""voice for the people,"" but was short on specifics.""I really don't know. That's the key factor. I don't know what I don't know, so I will learn what I need to know,"" Durr said. ""I'm going to guarantee you one thing: I will be the voice, and people will hear me, because if there's one thing people will learn about me, I've got a big mouth.""Controversial tweetsThe Republican has already been asked to account for old tweets that were uncovered by news outlets, including CNN.CNN obtained cached and archived copies of tweets from Durr in which he indicates support for QAnon and expresses Islamophobia.In one tweet from 2019, Durr referred to the Prophet Muhammad as a ""pedophile"" and Islam as ""a false religion"" and ""a cult of hate."" In another tweet published in the summer of 2020, Durr wrote to another Twitter user using the hashtag ""WWG1WGA,"" a well-known QAnon phrase that means, ""Where we go one, we go all."" Durr also expressed xenophobic ideas, tweeting in 2018 that Murphy should ""stop pushing #sanctuary state & inviting #illegals to our state."" He added the hashtags ""#BuildTheWall,"" ""#NoIllegals"" and ""#MAGA."" CNN also unearthed a tweet from Durr at the state's first lady, Tammy Murphy, calling Covid-19 the ""China virus"" and blaming the ""influx of #IllegalAliens"" for ""the return of diseases."" In response to an online article about police being directed to use correct pronouns for transgender people, he tweeted, ""Not enough that police must deal with all the issues with criminals, now they must watch what pronouns they used. Intelligence has no place in Trenton!"" Durr also denied climate change in a tweet, saying, ""1st there is no climate crisis, climate change its call seasons."" He called Planned Parenthood ""murderers"" in the same tweet.Durr's Twitter account has since been deleted. CNN has contacted Durr and Twitter for comment. In a statement to CNN affiliate KYW, the Republican apologized for his previous Islamophobic comments.""I'm a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment. If I said things in the past that hurt anybody's feelings, I sincerely apologize. I support everybody's right to worship in any manner they choose and to worship the God of their choice. I support all people and I support everybody's rights. That's what I am here to do, work for the people and support their rights."" It is not clear if he was asked about the other offensive posts. Durr, who CNN has not been able to reach directly, agreed to meet with Muslim community leaders from his district and representatives from the Council on American-Islamic Relations next week, Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the organization's New Jersey chapter, told CNN on Friday.Durr's statement apologizing for his Islamophobic tweets prompted the council to urge him to ""meet with Muslim leaders and fully repudiate his comments and address the concerns of the Muslim community.""""This 'apology' fails to address the issues with Mr. Durr's bigoted, anti-Muslim statements. We urge him to meet with Muslim leaders and fully repudiate his comments and address the concerns of the Muslim community,"" the national organization tweeted.Maksut on Saturday told CNN's Evan McMorris-Santoro that his organization hopes they can change his perspective on the Muslim faith.""Through conversation and sincere dialogue, I think that people can change but it requires effort, it requires sincerity. And ultimately, there is no benefit in cornering him,"" Maksut said. ""So, with a conversation, maybe two or three, and through experience and coming to see the community, coming to learn from his own constituents who are Muslim, we do think we can change his perspective on the faith and the people who follow the religion of Islam. It is really the only option we have. It is really our obligation as Muslims to do it.""No concession from SweeneyDurr in his campaign video cast Sweeney as a rubber stamp for Murphy, saying he ""sat by and watched"" as Murphy mishandled the Covid-19 pandemic. Durr also criticized the state's tax policies, a staple of Ciattarelli's campaign message.""The Senate President has spent 20 years in Trenton,"" Durr says in the clip, which begins with him exiting the cab of a truck and ends with him riding off on a motorcycle. ""Higher taxes, increasing debt and rising cost of living -- we deserve better. New Jersey, it's time for a change. So together, let's end single-party rule.""Sweeney, who has beaten back better-organized, heavily funded challengers in the past, has not yet conceded the race.Despite the Republican's surprise victory, New Jersey's legislature will remain under Democratic control. But the backlash in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democrats lost the governor's mansion and full control of the House of Delegates, has sent shockwaves across the country. Democrats already expecting a challenging 2022 midterm election season are now scrambling to draw up a message to protect the party's fragile congressional majorities.This story has been updated with additional reporting Friday.CNN's Jennifier Agiesta and Chris Cillizza contributed to this report.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211105150328-ed-durr-file-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/politics/ed-durr-steve-sweeney-new-jersey-senate-district-3/index.html,politics
123,Fears of unlikely federal gun-control measures lead to raft of state laws,"Brandon Steele, a second-term Republican in West Virginia's House, worked hard this year to get his colleagues to pass his ""Second Amendment Preservation Act."" It seeks to bar state or local police from enforcing new federal gun restrictions the Biden administration might adopt. Mind you, Steele himself concedes he doesn't see significant new federal restrictions getting passed anytime soon. ""The Biden administration has not gotten anywhere in terms of pushing their firearms regulatory agenda; they haven't even got their ATF guy in there,"" he told CNN. ""There are a lot of forces in play to keep that from happening.""With a 50-50 US Senate, a paper-thin margin in the House, and Biden focused on other priorities, advocates on both sides acknowledge that sweeping measures to address gun violence appear unlikely.But that hasn't stopped gun-rights groups and politicians across the country from ginning up fears that Biden wants to, as Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz put it, ""erase the Second Amendment,"" and come to people's homes and take away their guns. GOP lawmakers in at least 17 states have introduced bills this year taking aim at possible federal gun restrictions, a CNN review has found. Nine of those states signed new laws that take a page from the immigration sanctuary movement (which limited state and local police from helping with federal immigration enforcement), by barring local and state police agencies from helping enforce any new federal gun laws.  And two states, Missouri and Arizona, enacted measures that conflict with existing federal gun laws in ways that prosecutors tell CNN already are making it harder, or risk making it harder, to investigate gun crimes.  The inflammatory rhetoric surrounding these new laws, critics says, is similar and even connected to claims of 2020 election fraud and pushback against Covid-19 vaccine or mask mandates in that they rely on a denial of reality. ""They are part of an ideological system, [and believe] that the other side -- in this case, the Democrats -- are devious and intent on taking political rights away and imposing a socialistic tyranny,"" said Alexandra Filindra, a political science professor at University of Illinois, Chicago, who studies gun politics, disinformation and social media. ""Information that conflicts with this narrative is dismissed,"" she said. ""Saying Biden is a Democrat and coming for your guns is a great way to motivate anger and get people to vote in the midterm, especially."" Missouri ""suspends participation""While most of the new gun laws are aimed at some perceived future threat to gun ownership, the ones in Missouri and Arizona, at a minimum, have the potential to undermine present-day law enforcement investigations. Soon after Missouri adopted its ""Second Amendment Preservation Act"" in June, at least a dozen federally deputized state and local law enforcement officers withdrew from joint task forces where they'd worked with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate violent gun crimes and illegal gun trafficking, according to Frederic Winston, the head of ATF's Kansas City field office.Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. John Hotz confirmed it ""has suspended participation"" in ATF's joint task force. As a result, Winston said, the patrol stopped submitting firearms-trace requests to ATF, and stopped assisting in referrals to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, for investigations of people who get a firearm from a licensed dealer despite being prohibited from doing so. Missouri's act seeks to nullify any federal gun laws that tax guns, ammunition or accessories; that register or track firearms or firearms ownership; or that would confiscate or forbid the ownership, use, or transfer of guns by ""law-abiding citizens."" It says no state or local officers or officials ""can have authority to enforce or attempt to enforce"" such laws.State lawmakers also adopted an approach used in Texas' controversial abortion legislation by letting residents sue, for up to $50,000, local or state police who enforce federal gun laws that fall afoul of the act. Frederic Winston, the head of the ATF's Kansas City field office, said in a court declaration that the act ""deprives law enforcement of information needed to successfully investigate crimes, including violent crimes."" The city of St. Louis filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law shortly after it was passed. The Department of Justice supported that effort, arguing that under the US ""Constitution's Supremacy Clause, the State of Missouri has no power to nullify federal laws."" Like Missouri's law, Arizona's ""Second Amendment Sanctuary"" act, signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey in May, applies to current federal firearms laws. It orders state and local police agencies not to enforce or cooperate with any federal measures that are ""inconsistent with any law of this state regarding the regulation of firearms."" That bar on enforcement is modeled on California's 2017 immigration sanctuary law, state Rep. Leo Biasiucci, its author, told The Washington Monthly. Biasiucci didn't respond to repeated interview requests from CNN.States can't simply claim to nullify federal firearms laws that go farther than state laws, said Jonathan Lowy, chief legal counsel of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. If they think a law is unconstitutional, they can challenge it in court, he said. ""That's the way you do it:  You challenge laws. You don't say, 'I'm not going to follow federal law.'""Unlike in Missouri, federal and state law enforcement officials in Arizona say they haven't seen changes in joint task forces or other collaborations to investigate illegal gun trafficking or violent gun crimes. Arizona's gun law did swiftly draw a backlash from the Tucson City Council, which in June adopted a resolution to continue enforcing federal gun laws.  Tucson, where several churches were early leaders in the 1980s immigration sanctuary movement, and where the 2011 shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and 18 other people in a grocery-store parking lot remains etched into memory, has often clashed with the state's GOP-dominated leadership. ""We fully intend to enforce federal gun laws in Arizona,"" said Tucson City Council Member Steve Kozachik. ""I believe their nullification amendment is highly unconstitutional, and it's not anywhere close to being in the best interests of our constituents to say we're going to opt out of federal gun laws.""Immigration sanctuary modelLegal experts across the spectrum say that while provisions in Missouri and Arizona's laws appear to go too far, other recent acts, such as West Virginia's ""Second Amendment Preservation and Anti-Federal Commandeering Act,"" are likely to survive legal challenges. Those measures rely on what's known as the ""anti-commandeering"" doctrine, which holds that the federal government can't make state or local authorities enforce federal regulations on its behalf. That doctrine has repeatedly been upheld in recent cases involving immigration-sanctuary laws adopted by dozens of cities, from Seattle and San Francisco to Jackson, Mississippi.  ""It's perfectly constitutional for state officials to opt not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement or federal gun enforcement,"" said Eric Ruben, an assistant professor of law at Southern Methodist University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy think tank. Some state GOP lawmakers who, under President Donald Trump, passed laws to preempt cities from declaring themselves immigration sanctuaries, initially shied at embracing a sanctuary approach for guns. ""I actually had some members balk at the concept of using the word sanctuary,"" said state Rep. Scotty Campbell, of Mountain City, Tennessee, about his gun-protection bill. ""I argued it was known and understood as a Second Amendment Sanctuary. They didn't want to use the word sanctuary.""  The new laws seeking to stave off gun restrictions echo gun-advocacy efforts under President Barack Obama that led to seven states adopting similar measures between 2010 and 2016.  Even modest efforts to address gun safety often are painted by opponents as apocalyptic threats. Groups such as Gun Owners of America characterized Biden's recent call to restrict stabilizing gun braces, for example, as ""disarming the American people.""Last fall, the Trump campaign ran ads in key battleground states that clipped comments Biden made during a CNN interview, taking them out of context to falsely make it sound as though he planned to take away voters' guns. Cruz shared a similar false video on social media on the eve of Biden's first joint address to Congress, and claimed that Biden wants to ""erase the Second Amendment."" In September, Fox News explicitly tied guns and Covid-19 together with a piece titled: ""Second Amendment groups on Biden mandate: If he can force a needle in your arm, can he take your gun?""  In interviews with CNN, lawmakers in several states cited such fears as justification for their gun-rights bills.""We didn't know how far they'd go to restrict private gun ownership,"" said Arkansas state Rep. Brandt Smith, for example. ""Confiscation of guns? Restrictions of the purchase of firearms? We wanted to be proactive and prevent that."" Americans own more guns than ever, and more guns per capita than any other country in the world. Researchers for the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey estimated that Americans, with 4.3% of the world's population, owned 393 million guns, or 46% of all guns owned by private citizens worldwide, in 2018, the most recent year the survey was conducted. And Americans have bought an estimated 36.9 million more firearms in the past two years, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm based in South Carolina. Since the US has no national gun registry, gun ownership and sales are estimated by surveys, firearms industry publications, and background checks. These GOP-led efforts to guard against future gun restrictions come at a time when some gun-control measures enjoy broad support. More than 80 percent of people in the US (including 70 percent of Republicans) said they support expanded background checks for guns, in an April 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center. The survey said about half of Americans see gun violence as a major problem in the US -- understandable, given that, according to the Gun Violence Archive, 37,820 people have been shot to death in the US this year through Nov. 4, including 20,328 suicides. But it's the fear of losing guns that animates the call to bar such measures. State Sen. Joey Hensley, who cosponsored a Second Amendment sanctuary bill in Tennessee, said his constituents ""were very concerned about the federal government making more restrictions"" on guns.  ""I'm personally not afraid so much of the federal government. I think we have plenty of protections under the Second Amendment and I think the Supreme Court would protect our rights,"" said Hensley. ""But we wanted to get some legislation on the books, so people knew where we stood."" Filindra, the political scientist, said that the gun-rights narrative has been shifting, from a focus on using guns for self or home protection, to ""the idea that citizens have a right to arms as a check on government, and that without that, the franchise is insecure ... if the voting box is insufficient to guarantee our rights, we have the ammo box."" In this narrative, she said, ""threats to gun rights are existential threats to democracy."" Whether or not Congress actually can pass a substantial gun-control measure is beside the point, said Sarah Byner, research director for Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics and its effect on public policies and elections. ""That's something about the political climate we're in. Even if it's out of the realm of anything being discussed in the Congress, people aren't following Congress; people aren't police experts. They respond to the messages and that's what these groups are putting out into the world, facts be damned,"" she said.

125,These are the people who made history on election night,"A number of trailblazing candidates made history this week, as CNN projected that people of color across the country were elected to top positions at both the state and city level.Here's a look at some of the historic firsts from Election Night 2021. Winsome Sears, VirginiaWinsome Sears, a conservative Republican, will be Virginia's next lieutenant governor, breaking barriers as the first female and the first woman of color in the office in the commonwealth's 400-year legislative history. Sears defeated Democrat Del. Hala Ayala, also a woman of color.""It's a historic night -- yes, it is -- but I didn't run to make history. I just wanted to leave it better than I found it,"" Sears said before a crowd of supporters early Wednesday morning.Sears, who was born in Jamaica, was the first Black Republican woman to be elected to the Virginia General Assembly, representing the 90th district for one term. Michelle Wu, Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu will become Boston's next mayor, making her the first woman and person of color elected to the top post in the city's history. Wu, a 36-year-old progressive Democrat who touted policies like a Green New Deal for Boston and a fare-free transit system, will now serve as mayor in a city which has long been led by White men.""From every corner of our city, Boston has spoken. We are ready to meet this moment. We are ready to become a Boston for everyone,"" Wu said to a crowd of supporters Tuesday night.Wu clinched the title over City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George, who is also a woman of color. Previously, Wu was the first Asian American woman elected to the Boston City Council. While Wu is the first woman of color to be elected mayor in Boston, she is not the first woman of color to hold the seat. Wu will succeed acting mayor Kim Janey, Boston's first Black and female mayor. Janey, then-City Council President, was next in line to lead the city when Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was named President Joe Biden's Labor secretary in January.Ed Gainey, PittsburghPennsylvania State Rep. Ed Gainey was elected the first Black mayor of Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The Democratic politician bested Republican Tony Moreno, a retired Pittsburgh police officer, after running on a campaign to make Pittsburgh the country's most ""safe, affordable and diverse"" city and touting police reform and affordable housing. He has represented Pittsburgh in the state legislature since 2013 and previously worked for Pittsburgh Mayors Luke Ravenstahl and Tom Murphy.""This victory isn't just my victory, it's a Pittsburgh victory,"" Gainey said on Twitter Tuesday night.Aftab Pureval, CincinnatiAftab Pureval, a Democrat, was elected mayor of Cincinnati on Tuesday, becoming the first ever Asian American to hold the position. Pureval, a 39-year-old attorney, defeated city councilor David Mann, also a Democrat who previously served as mayor of Cincinnati and represented Ohio in the US House of Representatives, to clinch the city's top post. ""Words can't express how honored and excited I am to be the next Mayor of Cincinnati. Tonight, we made history! Let's get to work,"" Pureval said on Twitter Tuesday.Bruce Harrell, SeattleBruce Harrell, a Democrat, will become Seattle's first Asian American mayor. The moderate former city council president defeated progressive City Council President Lorena González, clinching the seat. Harrell, who is Japanese American and Black, is also Seattle's second Black mayor. Elaine O'Neal, DurhamElaine O'Neal will be first Black woman mayor of Durham, North Carolina. O'Neal, a former judge and former interim dean of North Carolina Central University Law School, ran on boosting public safety, access to housing and jobs. Her opponent, City Council member Javiera Caballero, suspended her campaign after the primary but stayed on the ballotEric Adams, New York City In addition to a number of historic firsts, New York City saw a historic second, as Eric Adams became the second Black mayor in the city's history. Adams, a Democrat, is a retired New York Police Department captain who embraced a public safety message. A Brooklyn native who currently serves as its borough president, Adams won a chaotic Democratic primary this summer on a promise to both beef up and reform the NYPD amid worries over a rise in violent crime. His message -- that ""public safety is the prerequisite to prosperity"" -- resonated with working class Democratic voters outside the traditionally liberal enclaves of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, which fueled his nomination.CNN's Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211103123936-historic-firsts-split-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/03/politics/historic-firsts-2021-election/index.html,politics
127,First person of color confirmed as permanent Census Bureau director,"The Senate voted on Thursday to confirm Robert Santos as director of the Census Bureau, making him the first person of color to hold the position in a permanent capacity. Santos, who is Mexican American, was confirmed in a 58-35 vote. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in voting to confirm him. Santos ""is an expert in survey sampling, survey design and more generally in social science/policy research, with over 40 years of experience,"" the White House said in a statement at the time of his nomination. He currently serves as vice president and chief methodologist at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization.President Joe Biden's selection of Santos had followed a turbulent year at the Census Bureau after the coronavirus pandemic hit just as the massive once-a-decade effort to count the US population was getting underway and scrambled the agency's plans.The census, which happens every 10 years, determines how many representatives each state gets in Congress, and how billions of dollars in federal funding is spent. Schools, roads and other important things in your community will gain -- or lose -- funding over the next 10 years depending on this official population tally. The most recent count was mired in political controversy following the Trump administration's drive to compile citizenship data and use it to the benefit of Republicans in an effort experts called unprecedented. Former President Donald Trump had specifically attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted when seats in Congress are divvied up between the states.Biden issued an executive order on his first day in office requiring non-citizens to be included in the Census and apportionment of congressional representatives. He rescinded the Trump-era policy saying that it ""conflicted with the principle of equal representation enshrined in our Constitution, census statutes, and historical tradition.""California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, the son of a cook and house cleaner who immigrated from Mexico, tweeted about the confirmation, saying in part, ""Great news! We just confirmed Robert Santos as Director of the Census Bureau—the first Latino to hold the position permanently. An accurate census is critical to our democracy & economy.""Santos' term is set to last five years and expire on December 31, 2026.CNN's Paul Leblanc contributed to this report.

128,White House aide who tested positive for Covid-19 during foreign trip remains in Scotland,"A White House official tested positive for Covid-19 during President Joe Biden's foreign trip and is now quarantining in Scotland, another White House official confirmed Thursday. The aide, whom the White House is not identifying out of privacy concerns, tested positive on Tuesday -- Biden's last day attending the global climate summit -- ""although additional tests to date have been inconclusive.""""This individual did not have close contact with the President and is not exhibiting any symptoms,"" the separate White House official said. ""The person has remained in Scotland to complete the quarantine period with the support of the administration.""The White House also had several staff members who had close contact with the person who tested positive travel separately back to the United States. ""All close contacts tested negative via PCR upon arrival in the United States. Additionally, the President tested negative on Tuesday,"" the separate official said. The news comes after high-profile members of the Biden administration tested positive for the virus in recent weeks.White House press secretary Jen Psaki had dropped off of Biden's international trip last week after members of her household tested positive for Covid-19. Shortly afterward, Psaki announced she herself had tested positive. She said in a statement on Sunday that she was disclosing the positive test result ""out of an abundance of transparency,"" adding that ""thanks to the vaccine,"" she was experiencing only mild symptoms and was working remotely.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas tested positive last month, forcing him to work from home instead of traveling to Bogota, Colombia.Biden and his administration are urging Americans to get vaccinated. ""Later this month, our tables and hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines,"" Biden said on Wednesday while addressing the news that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had authorized the Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11.

129,Harris looks to strengthen US-France ties in 'concrete ways' on Paris trip,"Vice President Kamala Harris will pursue US efforts to strengthen a recently mended French-American relationship during a trip to Paris next week, where she will also attend a pair of international conferences.Harris will sit down for a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace next Wednesday before delivering remarks at the Macron-hosted Paris Peace Forum and participating in a multilateral conference on Libya. Harris' trip comes less than two months after France temporarily recalled its ambassador to the US to protest a US nuclear submarine deal with Australia, which sank a separate French contract to build conventional submarines for Australia. President Joe Biden last week sat down with Macron on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome and acknowledged that the US had been ""clumsy"" in its handling of the matter. ""The key message for this meeting is the importance of this relationship and the fact that US-French partnership matters to the world,"" a senior administration official said of the Harris-Macron meeting. Harris will be the most senior American official to attend the Paris Peace Forum since it was launched in 2018, though senior administration officials declined to say whether her attendance was part of an effort to mend the US-French rift. The senior administration official said the Biden administration is ""forward-looking"" in its relationship with France and that Harris will look to strengthen French-American cooperation ""in concrete ways,"" though the official declined to say specifically how Harris would seek to improve the relationship. The official said Harris and Macron plan to have a ""wide-ranging discussion across a range of issues to include the bilateral relationship, European security, the Indo-Pacific, global health, space and a number of other subjects."" A second senior official said Harris' remarks at the Paris Peace Forum on November 11 -- which will focus this year on global health and post-Covid recovery --  will address ""big, converging global crises"" with a focus on ""the challenge of rising inequality and the need for leaders around the world to join together and take bold action."" Harris will join Macron and other world leaders for a dinner following the forum. She is set to arrive in Paris on Tuesday and return to the US the following Saturday. Officials said Harris will tour the Institut Pasteur, a biomedical research institute, after her arrival and meet with French and American scientists working on Covid-19 and pandemic research. Harris will visit the Suresnes American Cemetery, just outside of Paris, on the eve of Veterans Day and participate in an Armistice Day ceremony the following day, visits intended to demonstrate ""the years that France and the United States have stood together, our shared values and our commitment to continue doing the right things together around the world,"" the first senior administration official said. On November 12, Harris will participate in an international conference on Libya alongside 20 heads of state and government, including Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. ""The vice president is attending to show US support for the Libyan people as they work to reestablish their sovereignty and establish lasting peace,"" the second senior administration official said. ""We want to show our support for the Libyan people as they move towards national elections and as they focus on the importance of the withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries and fighters.""  The official said Harris will also express ""deep concern for human rights and the situation of migrants and refugees.""

135,Biden administration rescinds Trump-era policy limiting migrants at legal ports of entry,"The Department of Homeland Security has rescinded a Trump-era policy limiting entry of undocumented immigrants at legal ports of entry and released new guidance on the process, according to a recently-released memo.Migrants seeking asylum can present at ports of entry to make their claim, but under the Trump administration, DHS put in place policies limiting the processing of undocumented immigrants, including asylum seekers, at ports. The practice, known as ""metering,"" essentially created a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the department had the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities. The latest memo, dated November 1, rescinds that policy, but migrants could still be expelled under a Trump-era public health order allowing the swift removal of migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border. ""This memo formally rescinds the Trump Administration's 'metering' policy, which was used to turn back asylum seekers trying to enter ports of entry (POE). The new guidance lays out a vision for the lawful, orderly processing of individuals applying for asylum at POEs. Among other improvements, CBP is directed to accelerate ongoing efforts to digitize processing at POEs and more effectively use data to increase throughput,"" US Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. Limiting entry of asylum seekers at legal ports of entry under the previous administration fielded criticism from immigrant advocates and attorneys who argued it denied asylum seekers the right to pursue their claims. A 2020 Homeland Security inspector general report also found that CBP staff turned away asylum seekers at some ports of entry and in some cases, that led asylum seekers and other undocumented immigrants to cross the US-Mexico border illegally. The Monday memo, from acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller, now directs Office of Field Operations management along the US southern border ""to consider and take appropriate measures, as operationally feasible, to increase capacity to process undocumented noncitizens at Southwest Border POEs, including those who may be seeking asylum and other forms of protection."" It also notes that other priorities, like facilitating trade, should be considered when processing undocumented immigrants.Those measures could include using a mobile application where undocumented immigrants can submit information and collaborating with non-governmental organizations and other partners. Port of entries ""must strive to process all travelers, regardless of documentation status, who are waiting to enter, as expeditiously as possible, based on available resources and capacity,"" the memo reads.DHS is also preparing to reopen the nation's land borders for Covid-19 vaccinated foreign nationals next week after travel was restricted due to the coronavirus.

140,"TV OT: Is TLC the weirdest network on TV? Plus, revisiting the fall's 'Big Leap' into less-'Ordinary' series ","Welcome to November. Insert your screams here. Enjoy this week's TV OT: Is TLC the weirdest network on TV?Although I generally prefer to keep my blemishes covered under layers of well-blended concealer, there's a public pimple I must pop in the name of transparency: Over the years, I have watched a lot of TLC. I'm someone who generally believes there should be no such term when talking television as ""guilty pleasure"" because you should not be ashamed of what brings you comfort. But I can't say that watching ""Sister Wives"" (returning Nov. 21) or ""My 600 lb. Life"" (new season airing now) or ""So Freakin' Cheap"" brings me anything resembling pleasure, but I can't stop. In that lies the mystery of what I'll now controversially say is television's weirdest and most fascinating network. Unlike streaming networks, which can bury their junk and still win awards for its prestige content or broadcast networks that have to worry deeply about offending any of their increasingly fewer viewers, TLC lives in their crud. Heck, they often celebrate it. (For the sake of this discussion, I'll make one quick point: I won't get into the network's utter failings in the handling of anything relating to the Duggars, but it is part of why I struggle with watching TLC period.)This is where I should point out that like any network, TLC has some range. For example, it has given a home to the inspiring story of transgender teen Jazz Jennings. ""I Am Jazz,"" entering its seventh season this month, has done volumes for bringing awareness to the challenges of being young and trans -- something that is arguably (and sadly) more needed now than when it premiered. The baffling part of TLC is that its spectrum has such an applaudable high and multiple in-the-bowels-of-television lows, of which I won't dare to pick the most objectionable. Though, if it was still on the air, it'd be the show where I once watched the story of a man who was in an intimate relationship with his car.  I know I'm not alone in watching any of it, though. TLC's ""90 Day Fiancé,"" franchise is a crazy success. (But one friend who used to watch it told me she stopped because the two-hour episodes and constant spin-offs was too much to keep up with) In a time when networks have a small stable of reliable performers, TLC has multiple shows that have been on for 6-plus seasons. (""Little People, Big World"" wrapped up Season 22 earlier this year.) And one of its newer shows, ""Dr. Pimple Popper,"" is so popular, it's getting a Christmas Special — subtitled ""A Pimple Carol."" ""It's unlike any other programming on TV right now,"" says one friend, who spoke on a condition of anonymity and we all understand why. ""It's against social norms. We don't have a lot of drama in our lives, but we watch it on TV."" This one half of a married couple says they've watched everything from ""90 Day Fiancé"" to ""Extreme Sisters,"" a series that explored sisters whose close bonds veer into baffling territory.  The other half of the couple adds: ""It's a world you just don't know. You get sucked in.""  And maybe that the secret? TLC is the television equivalent of a highway car crash that you can't look away from. The loudest objection I hear to TLC programming is that it can feel exploitative and often mean in spirit. But I'd argue we are all accountable for our own reactions to the stories we see in the same way the participants are accountable for agreeing to be featured. Do I judge weird couples? Yes. But do I also cry watching ""My 600 Lb. Life""? Absolutely. And did everyone featured on any of these shows knowingly sign up to be on TV? Definitely. TLC hasn't been The Learning Channel for a long time, to the disappointment of many. But they've found success, perhaps, in deciding that there was an audience for Television that Loathes the Conventional.  Revisiting the fall's 'Big Leap' into less-'Ordinary' seriesNow, tossing it over to Brian Lowry with a mid-fall TV update. ""One of the problems reviewing series that have slightly more ambition than 'FBI' spinoffs is the question of whether a frontloaded couple of episodes can actually be sustained over the course of a season, much less multiple seasons.Happily, three network shows that earned the most favorable reactions when they made their debuts this fall -- ""The Big Leap,"" ""Ordinary Joe"" and 'Ghosts' -- continue to hold up quite well.Fox's 'Big Leap' might be the most impressive of the bunch, finding clever layers as it combines the characters -- participating in a fictitious reality-TV dance show -- in unexpected ways. It's consistently sweet, funny and fairly smart about how the reality sausage gets made, with Scott Foley shining as the amoral producer who'll step over pretty much anyone in pursuit of a second-season renewal.NBC's 'Ordinary Joe,' meanwhile, has built on its pilot with details about the central character, played by James Wolk, following him on three separate paths diverted by one decision he made at a crucial point in his life. A little strained at times, it remains a feat of editing and has steadily dropped new tidbits to expand the story.Finally, 'Ghosts' has stood out as a non-cookie-cutter comedy for CBS, with a couple moving into a house inhabited by ghosts from different eras. Although it has the benefit of being adapted from a British show, that's no guarantee of durability on a more expansive US TV schedule, which the show has thus far exhibited.All told, it's an encouraging sign for the major networks, which at times have appeared willing to ride their existing franchises ('Chicago' everything, 'Law & Order,' etc.) into a steady march toward oblivion.These new shows suggest there's life in the model, especially if you'll take a few creative risks to expand it.""'Class' dismissedFor your weekend watch list, here's Lowry again with a recommendation. ""OK, we get it, established intellectual property is all the rage, but the new 'Head of the Class' revival, on HBO Max (like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia), feels more peripherally tethered to the mildly memorable show that preceded it than most.Here, Isabella Gomez (a veteran of the 'One Day at a Time' revival) plays the slacker teacher to a group of high-achieving kids, in a series that feels as generic as that sounds. Despite the fresh faces, there's little to distinguish this from a network sitcom in the 1980s.As for connections to the original, Robin Givens shows up in a subsequent episode, which is nice.In terms of making us look with the title, mission accomplished. Making us stick around is another matter.""A 'Symbol'-ic gestureAnd another from Lowry: a programming note for the Peacock-less.""NBC developed 'The Lost Symbol,' based on Dan Brown's Robert Langdon character, for the network, then decided to premiere the series on its streaming service, Peacock. Now the show is getting a one-time showing on NBC in place of an 'Ordinary Joe' repeat.It's a small thing, but the synergistic move is another example of the juggling act that studios face as they consider where their shows will fare the best. Frankly, 'Lost Symbol' might have been a long shot in any venue, but like 'Head of the Class,' it probably would have looked more at home on a broadcast network in the first place.""",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211105134628-90-day-fiance-tlc-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/entertainment/what-to-watch-tlc-big-leap/index.html,entertainment

143,"Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot go for the green in 'Red Notice'","""Red Notice"" has the polished feel of something concocted in a lab for maximum social-media attention (Dwayne Johnson! Ryan Reynolds! Gal Gadot!), then pieced together Frankenstein-style from parts of other movies. Yet the net effect is mildly enjoyable, creating a throwback caper film that showcases its stars doing what they do best, or rather for which they're best known.Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who teamed with Johnson, whose company produced the film, on ""Central Intelligence"" and ""Skyscraper""), ""Red Notice""borrows unabashedly from other films but doesn't appear the least bit red-faced or apologetic about it. There's the mismatched cop-thief pairing from ""48 Hrs.,"" the party sequence from ""True Lies,"" the clue-solving from ""National Treasure,"" and so on.Any movie that jokes about the sought-after loot being a MacGuffin, a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's name for whatever priceless artifact set his plots in motion, or has Reynolds whistle the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" march clearly isn't taking itself too seriously.Again, though, it generally works, with Johnson as Agent John Hartley, an FBI profiler (a little bulky for that gig, as is pointed out) on the trail of Reynolds' Nolan Booth, a master thief searching for three gold-plated eggs of immeasurable value given to Cleopatra.Their relationship is complicated by another thief, Gadot's The Bishop -- like Booth, given a ""red notice,"" or ""most wanted"" tag, by the international agency Interpol -- who invariably seems to be one step ahead of both of them, forcing the two to grudgingly team up.Globetrotting hijinks ensue, with scads of action and fighting but little in the way of blood or bodies, keeping things relatively light and, a few naughty words and sexual references aside, family friendly.Nobody can be accused of stretching their creative portfolio here, with Reynolds tossing off one smart-alecky one-liner after another (mostly at Johnson's expense), Johnson portraying a square-jawed hero and Gadot proving mysterious, alluring and characteristically wonder-ful. (When she turns up in a slinky red dress, Reynolds dryly tells her she looks OK.)Like Reynolds' earlier film for the service ""6 Underground,"" it's the sort of big, muscular action vehicle that certainly wouldn't look out of place in theaters, buttressing Netflix's desire to offer a little something for everyone with an off-the-charts ""You might like"" factor to feed the service's algorithms.Indeed, having this movie arrive heading into the service's twin onslaught of holiday fare and award contenders almost plays like a calculated alternative, cheerfully free of any pretensions about high art. Let other movies fret about taking home gold. Like its thieves, ""Red Notice"" is transparently committed to going for the green.""Red Notice"" premieres in select theaters on Nov. 5 and Nov. 12 on Netflix.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211103172855-02-red-notice-netflix-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/05/entertainment/red-notice-review/index.html,entertainment

145,"Tom Hanks is alone again in 'Finch,' with only a dog and robot for company","Apple TV+ must really like Tom Hanks, with ""Finch"" representing the second movie featuring the actor the service scooped up during the pandemic. Like ""Greyhound,"" this one is in a modest affair that would likely have been hard-pressed to make waves in theaters, casting Hanks in a last-man-on-Earth scenario that's part ""Cast Away,"" part ""WALL-E.""Indeed, although production wrapped before the pandemic, the premise -- which casts Hanks as the title character, a robotics engineer by training, who survives an apocalypse (eventually explained) with only his dog and a newly operative robot -- would have been ideal for shooting under Covid protocols with such a limited cast.The robot (performed Caleb Landry Jones) takes the name Jeff, and like a number of recent projects, ""Finch"" winds up being an exploration not only of the man's fight for survival but the machine's dawning humanity, with Finch programming it to make caring for the dog, should anything happen to him, its prime directive.Most of the movie focuses on Finch and his companions struggling against the elements, forced to flee by unpredictable weather and massive storms while searching for places that ""haven't been ransacked or looted.""Along the way, Finch teaches Jeff how to drive (the robot insists he's ""an excellent driver,"" inviting a ""Rain Man"" reference), tells stories that offer a modest window into his past and searches for canned food for man and beast.Director Miguel Sapochnik (""Game of Thrones"") does what he can to wring the maximum amount of emotion out of this unlikely trio, finding moments of tenderness and humor in their interactions. The on-the-road format also owes something to another recent Hanks movie, ""News of the World,"" traveling there by wagon instead of RV.Yet even with Hank's innate likability that feels like a limited template, making this one of those road movies that proceeds at a decent pace but doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. Moreover, the underlying scenario is so bleak as to somewhat offset the lighter elements, despite the very good boy and robot that accompany him.Studios have been fairly shrewd about which movies to hold until theatrical release became possible and which to sell to streaming services hungry for programming, especially with someone like Hanks to help promote it.""Finch"" is practically a poster child for that latter category, the kind of film that delivers a bigger pop as an entry on Apple TV+'s playlist than it does on your screen.""Finch"" premieres Nov. 5 on Apple TV+.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211102171935-finch-review-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/04/entertainment/finch-review/index.html,entertainment

153,"ABBA are back with their first album in 40 years, but is it a Super Trouper or an SOS?","Four decades since their last album, Swedish pop legends ABBA are finally back, in one of the most anticipated musical returns in recent years. Anni-Frid ""Frida"" Lyngstad, Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog reunited this year after going their separate ways in 1982. ""ABBA: Voyage,"" their new album released Friday, features 10 tracks and is their first since ""The Visitors"" in 1981.  So, was it worth the wait?  For many fans, it's safe to say absence does makes the heart grow fonder. ""It's ARRIVED with only 40 years delayed,"" one fan tweeted, while another said: ""HAPPY VOYAGE DAY!!!"" Another commentator wrote: ""It's no pop classic, but it has some beautiful ABBA flourishes. The voices are just beautiful - Benny & Björn have deliberately avoided using modern overly produced vocals, but some of the lyrics are twee. However, it's polished, inoffensive and a grower. A fitting final farewell."" Another fan added on Twitter: ""The most remarkable thing about Voyage is that it's new ABBA that's still perfectly ABBA after all these years, but you haven't heard it a thousand times yet."" Among music critics, however, opinion was more divided.   Awarding the record five stars, the UK's The Independent described the project as ""a triumphant album awash with ABBA's gung-ho uncoolness"" that ""delivers all the classic ABBA flavours."" According to Pitchfork's Ben Cardew, the album falls ""between the lure of nostalgia and the pull of the present day."" He wrote: ""Voyage is the rare post-reformation album to build upon the band's legacy without abandoning what we loved about their classic records in the first place. That makes Voyage a surprisingly necessary trip into the present from a band who could have coasted on the warm fumes of adulation ad infinitum."" Writing for the UK's Telegraph, Neil McCormick said ""ABBA: Voyage"" was a ""gentle OAP cruise around the backwaters of ABBA's reputation."" He added that while Fältskog and Lyngstad ""can still hold a tune,"" Andersson and Ulvaeus ""have not lost their ability to craft a flowing melody adorned with glittering hooks."" But in a two-star review headlined ""No thank you for the music,"" the Guardian's Jude Rogers described ABBA's ninth album as a ""disappointment"" that ""prefers to languish in often bafflingly retrograde settings."" ""Rather than reflecting poignantly on the past, much of the rest of Voyage feels terminally stuck there,"" she wrote, before branding ""Little Things"", a Christmas song, a ""big crime against sense, sentimentality and sequencing.""The Sydney Morning Herald's Barry Divola was similarly brutal in his assessment, writing: ""The bad news is that there's a bunch of utter schlock here,"" and giving the album 2.5 stars. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield, on the other hand, declared: ""This album would be a one-of-a-kind historic event even if the songs blew -- but it's vintage ABBA, on par with their classic 1970s run. It evokes the days when the Norse gods ruled the radio, combining two of the Seventies' hottest trends: heartbreak and sequin-studded pantsuits.""

162,'Spencer' shows off Kristen Stewart in a 'fable' about Diana's break from the Royals,"Kristen Stewart's fierce, attention-grabbing work as Princess Diana really ought to be viewed independently of ""Spencer,"" described as ""a fable from a true tragedy"" that presents a pivotal weekend in Princess Diana's split from the Royal Family. That is, it's possible to admire the performance and still come away feeling director Pablo Larrain's fictionalized movie doesn't significantly add to a story many of us already know in exhaustive detail.Larrain, notably, offered a similar take on American royalty with ""Jackie,"" which starred Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy. In what is becoming his anthology of famous women facing crises, he has created another strong showcase for the star while crafting a movie that's a little too precious for its own good.""Spencer"" (Diana's surname, for any who have forgotten) takes off in speculative ways based on a real moment, when Diana spent Christmas weekend with the Royals at the Queen's Sandringham Estate as her marriage to Prince Charles (Jack Farthing) was crumbling. Arriving late, she's alternately depressed and defiant, well aware that all eyes are on her even before being warned that the press is ""circling us.""The dissonant music thus becomes a proxy for what's going on inside Diana's head (some of her long walks down the hall bring to mind ""The Shining""), as she reads a book about the ill-fated Anne Boleyn and wonders whether she could wind up on the chopping block. She also is dealing with bulimia, to the point where the chef worries about her meals and Charles asks her not to purge them. Diana's rebelliousness catches the eye of a starched bureaucrat (Timothy Spall) who is there to keep an eye on her and mitigate potential harm to the family. The most sympathetic presence, meanwhile, is Diana's dresser (Sally Hawkins), who doesn't bat an eye when Diana tells her an outfit ""doesn't fit my mood,"" and assesses her position vis-à-vis the Royal Family by saying, ""They can't change. You have to change.""Ultimately, ""Spencer"" seeks to be an ennobling account of Diana's ordeal, capturing her at a moment of profound unhappiness, where she appears to face a stark choice between breaking down or breaking free.Yet while Stewart puts her stamp on the character, the license that comes from labeling this a fable makes the movie play less like an attempt to get to the truth behind that turmoil than an indulgence with the misfortune of following an entire season devoted to it on ""The Crown,"" and less successfully the Netflix presentation ""Diana: The Musical.""Obviously, the enduring fascination with the Royals and those uneasily wearing crowns in general, and Diana in particular, makes this fertile territory -- the circling never stopped -- but once you get past how Stewart captures Diana's look and spirit, there's not much more to see or learn.In the same way the carefully orchestrated pictures and magazine covers created a veneer that often belied Diana's reality, ""Spencer"" is a case where the coming attractions essentially contain everything you need to know about the movie.""Spencer"" premieres Nov. 5 in US theaters.

163,Who are the Eternals? Get to know the Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest heroes,"In the last year, Marvel introduced viewers to Agatha Harkness and Monica Rambeau, Sylvie and Mobius, Yelena, Shang-Chi and a new Captain America, to name a few. Phew. Brace yourselves, fatigued fans, because the Marvel Cinematic Universe is adding at least 10 more new superheroes and villains this month in ""Eternals,"" the new film by Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao. You'll have a bit over a month to commit their names and stories to memory before Marvel unloads ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" onto audiences (and a few weeks after that, yet another hero is getting their own Disney+ show -- rest while you can).Lucky for you, we've created an ""Eternals"" cheat sheet of sorts so diehard and casual fans alike can keep things straight. Here's what you need to know about the Eternals before the film's release on November 5. (This writer has not seen the film yet, but light spoilers from the comics follow.) So ... who/what are the Eternals?The Eternals are not quite people, not quite gods (though humans often mistake them for gods, which annoys the space deities who created them and the Greek gods for which a few of the Eternals are named). Though they each have unique powers, they're all skilled warriors with super-strength, speed and agility. The heroes are mostly immortal -- even if their bodies are destroyed, they can live on in other ways. But they keep their powers secret since they live among humans. They were sent to Earth by the Celestials, an ancient group of godlike beings, some 7,000 years before the events of the film to defend humankind against the Deviants, mutant monsters also created by the Celestials when some tests on early Earth-dwellers went awry. The Eternals are advised against interfering in non-Deviant business, instead acting as mere spectators to human conflict unless Deviants are involved. While the Eternals have obeyed the Celestials until now, they're finally starting to question their mission and the beings who created them. Like most protagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe who have gotten their own origin stories, the Eternals probably don't fancy themselves superheroes. But by the film's end, after they've undergone various transformations and vanquish various foes, they'll likely be among the most powerful heroes in the MCU, and maybe, the MCM -- the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse. Meet Marvel's 10 EternalsIkarisPlayed by: Richard MaddenIn the comics, the Eternals are often led by Ikaris, usually portrayed as a blond-haired, blue-eyed muscleman reminiscent of He-Man but with laser eyes. In some comics appearances, he's been named the Prime Eternal, or the Eternal who rules over the rest. Powers: Laser-beam eyes. You name it, Ikaris can probably do it. He can fly at speeds up to 850 miles per hour, creates convincing illusions and shoots laser beams out of his eyes, among many other abilities. Who knew? In the comics, when he's in disguise as a human, he goes by the name ""Ike Harris."" Ikaris is definitely one of the brawniest Eternals, but creative, he is not. SersiPlayed by: Gemma ChanIf it's Ikaris who typically runs the Eternals in the comics sphere, Sersi is its heart. She's something of a historian of humankind, having had a first-row seat to events like the fall of Rome and the French Revolution, per Marvel. You'll often find Sersi in green, a nod, perhaps, to her deep love and appreciation of the Earth and its inhabitants. She's also had a centuries-long, on-and-off relationship with fellow Eternal, Ikaris. Powers: Matter transmutation. Basically, she can alter matter into any form she chooses (remember in the ""Eternals"" trailer, when she appears to dissolve a double decker bus into a parade of petals?). Who knew? In the comics, Sersi joined the Avengers for a spell. Though she later quit the group full-time, she sometimes still helps them out when they need a hand from a godlike hero.SpritePlayed by: Lia McHughSprite is as mischievous as her name suggests. Though she's just as old as her counterparts, she has the appearance of a perpetual preteen, which she uses to her advantage -- one comics run saw her starring in her own teen sitcom. Her naivety can also be disastrous, though: In one series, the Sprite ""altered reality on a cosmic scale,"" according to Marvel. Sprite has also been written as male in the comics for much of the character's run. Powers: Illusions. The group's ""grandiose storyteller,"" Sprite casts lifelike mirages and can teleport herself if needed. Who knew? She was once, according to Marvel, a thorn in the side of William Shakespeare, inspiring the Bard's character ""Puck"" in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""PhastosPlayed by: Brian Tyree HenryThe inventor of the group and a sworn pacifist, Phastos is also the first out, gay superhero in the MCU. (While Marvel comics feature a number of queer characters, only a few other characters -- including Valkyrie and Loki -- have been suggested, though not confirmed, to be queer onscreen.) Based on the film's trailers, he's also a frugal home decorator with a penchant for Ikea and sarcasm. Powers: Invention and ""technopathy."" If Phastos can see something in his mind's eye, he can make it real -- he has the ability to conjure up weapons and other inventions with little more than a thought. Who knew? At one point in the comics, he took the codename ""Ceasefire"" -- a nod to his stance against war. (No one tell him he's a superhero created to wage war against monsters!) ThenaPlayed by: Angelina JolieIt's no coincidence that Thena's name is so similar to that of the Greek goddess of war -- according to Marvel, Thena is ""more comfortable in battle than anywhere else."" Like Phastos, she can conjure weapons with her mind, though she takes pleasure in wielding them and unleashing cosmic, PG-13 carnage. Powers: Superhuman sparring. She's incredibly quick, strong, reflexive -- a nearly unbeatable warrior. Who knew? In the comics, she once had a dalliance with a Deviant leader named Kro, and their tumultuous relationship has hindered both the Eternals and their foes. AjakPlayed by: Salma HayekThough in the comics, Ajak is portrayed as male, Hayek said she sees her character as a maternal figure, a ""spiritual leader"" of sorts who connects with each of them even when they're at odds and keeps the group on course. Powers: Healing. Ajak heals both humans and Eternals, and she's one of the few to have direct contact with the Celestials to receive updates on their mission. Who knew? In the comics, Ajak is ""brilliant archaeologist and skilled wrestler,"" Marvel says. Even godlike heroes need hobbies.MakkariPlayed by: Lauren RidloffThe speed runner Makkari has dashed all around the planet and is, frankly, bored by what she's found. In the film, the Eternals ask her to put aside her boredom for a few days to help them defeat the Deviants and save the world so she can traverse other planets. Powers: Super speed. Quicksilver who? Makkari is the ""fastest woman in the universe,"" Marvel says. Who knew? Ridloff is deaf -- and Makkari is the first deaf superhero in the MCU -- so the Eternals communicate with Makkari via sign language. KingoPlayed by: Kumail Nanjiani While many of the other Eternals elected to live anonymously among humankind, Kingo became a film star (in the comics, he's an actor known for Japanese samurai films; in the film, he's a Bollywood performer). Powers: Fighting in style. Kingo can do what basically every Eternal can do -- kick butt with little effort, though he prefers to fend off foes with the panache of a leading man. He has the ego of one, too. Who knew? Kingo apparently fashions himself the star of the Eternals. Thena and Ikaris would like a word. GilgameshPlayed by: Don LeeThe strongest Eternal and Thena's partner, Gilgamesh is a fearsome warrior but also a pretty nice guy, according to Marvel. Powers: Indomitable strength. In battle, Gilgamesh employs a golden ""exoskeleton"" that protects his arms and fists and delivers devastating blows to enemies. Who knew? In the comics, he was known as ""the Forgotten One"" because he wasn't aware he was an Eternal for many years. DruigPlayed by: Barry KeoghanThere's a darkness to Druig that the other Eternals lack. In the comics, he's often prized his own success above the success of the Eternals and their mission to protect humans, which has made him dangerous. (Also in the comics, he's been drawn to resemble a vampire of sorts.) Powers: Mind control. Druig can see into humans' minds and exploit their vulnerabilities. Yikes!Who knew? Druig isolates himself from the other Eternals due to his, er, opposing view of how to live alongside humans, per Marvel. Bonus hero: Dane WhitmanPlayed by: Kit HaringtonOK, so, Whitman isn't a member of the Eternals, but he is Sersi's regular human boyfriend in the film. He may play a larger, more heroic role in upcoming Marvel projects, though nothing has been confirmed. We won't go into the finer details of his comic book history, but for readers who don't mind spoilers, Marvel has an expansive biography.

164,'Colin in Black & White' explores Colin Kaepernick's formative years but fumbles in its approach,"Colin Kaepernick possesses greater gifts as an athlete and activist than as a TV personality, which becomes apparent watching ""Colin in Black & White,"" a series that -- much like NBC's ""Young Rock"" -- revisits a famous person's early life, here by awkwardly mixing documentary and dramatic elements.As it happens, the Netflix show premieres the same day as another series connected to a pro athlete, NBA star Kevin Durant, who is among the producers of ""Swagger,"" an Apple TV+ series that looks at the often-unsavory, high-pressured world of youth basketball.""Colin"" is the higher-profile project, with Kaepernick having been left off an NFL roster since 2017, after taking a principled position over kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. Outspoken in the intervening period, the quarterback has teamed here with filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who directed the premiere of the six-episode series as well as the sequences in which Kaepernick speaks directly to the camera, illustrating his observations not only about his life but US history, race and inequality more broadly.Thanks to that hybrid format, ""Colin in Black & White"" feels stilted as Kaepernick stares intently at the camera discussing microaggressions, how Black people's advancement and acceptance invariably relies on ""a White man's stamp of approval,"" and occasionally watching reenacted scenes from his life.A more straightforward approach likely would have played better, and that structural fumble somewhat dilutes the dramatic sequences, which feature Kaepernick during his formative high-school years (well played by Jaden Michael). Mary-Louise Parker and Nick Offerman portray his adoptive parents, who at one point call him ""a thug"" because they disapprove of his hair, and often seem oblivious to indignities he faced from figures like police, hotel personnel and umpires, having excelled in baseball before settling on football as his chosen career path.Growing up with them, Kaepernick notes, ""I assumed their privilege was mine. I was in for a rude awakening.""At its core, the series serves as a venue to witness the racism Kaepernick experienced, conveyed in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, including the sidelong glances directed at a young Black man growing up in a predominantly White world. To those who only see professional athletes through the prism of wealth and fame, it's a reminder that they weren't always in that position.""Swagger"" covers similar territory, focusing on the pressure placed on teenagers in the pursuit to become NBA draft picks, beginning at a ridiculously young age.Here, the focus is on Jace (Isaiah Hill), a hugely talented 14-year-old who has ""NBA"" etched on his wall, a reminder of his ultimate goal as he participates in youth leagues and seeks to improve his game.His mother (Shinelle Azoroh) takes an active role in that, steering Jace to a youth coach (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) who was once a prized prospect himself, only to have lost that opportunity (a scenario explored via flashbacks) and now coaching as a way to stay close to basketball.Anyone familiar with the system -- from the shady role of agents to shoe companies trying to align themselves with future pros -- won't find a whole lot new here, and almost every episode seems to build toward a basketball game, complete with naysayers offering real-time commentary on social media.Durant joins other NBA stars -- including LeBron James and Stephen Curry -- by moonlighting in the production business, and ""Swagger"" has its moments. Yet for the most part, it plays more like a second-tier series than a blue-chip one.Similarly, it's possible to come away from ""Colin in Black & White"" with greater appreciation of Kaepernick's personal journey and what motivated him to take a stand at considerable personal cost, and still feel like they've used the wrong creative playbook to make this work as a TV show.""Colin in Black & White"" and ""Swagger"" premiere Oct. 29 on Netflix and Apple TV+, respectively.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211025215218-02-colin-in-black-and-white-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/27/entertainment/colin-in-black-and-white-review/index.html,entertainment
165,'Queens' gets the band back together for a soapy ABC drama,"""Queens"" is an extremely familiar idea, elevated not quite to the level of royalty by being slickly cast, packaged and produced. Like Peacock's ""Girls5eva,"" the concept hinges on an all-girl group reunited and again pursuing stardom 20 years later, rediscovering the spotlight and its perils after years spent braiding hair and burning breakfast.Those last mundane activities are how we meet Brianna (Eve), once known as Professor Sex, who is now raising five kids. Methodically, the show goes about introducing the rest of the quartet once known as the Nasty Bitches (a name itself rooted in the past), who, as Jill a.k.a. Da Thrill (Naturi Naughton), notes, ""stood on top of the world for a hot minute.""The other members of the group, Naomi/Xplicit Lyrics (Brandy) and Valeria/Butter Pecan (Nadine Velazquez), had a sour falling out, with the former toiling away as a solo act -- ""still chasing the fame that you found 20 years ago,"" as she's told -- and the latter having successfully transitioned into morning TV, where her unbridled ambition is on full display.It's their manager (Taylor Sele) who suggests getting the band back together as part of a televised event, and the lure of a quick payout is enough to erode the resistance on several fronts. But this is a series, after all, so the reunion won't end there, with the challenge of mounting a formal comeback and all the soapy doings that go with it.As noted, the idea of one-time stars nursing old grudges and grasping for another few minutes of fame is hardly a new one (Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" is an ode to one-hit wonders), but the hip-hop backdrop and casting gives ""Queens"" a relatively fresh feel. The disclaimer would be that once you get past the premise, the series becomes another soap set against the backdrop of the music world, a la ""Empire,"" meaning it will only be as good as the situations that the writers can continue to conjure.Produced by ""Scandal"" alum Zahir McGhee (who wrote the pilot) and directed by Tim Story, ""Queens"" appears to be in pretty good hands on that score, even if the content and actually-not-that-explicit lyrics can only be as nasty as ABC's standards will allow. The show also figures to get a boost, in old-fashioned TV scheduling terms, from having ""The Bachelorette"" as its opening act.For now, ""Queens"" has done an admirable job assembling the pieces. Keeping them from flaming out the way that the show's fictional group did could be another matter.""Queens"" premieres Oct. 19 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210902034712-01-queens-abc-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/entertainment/queens-review/index.html,entertainment
166,'Succession' doesn't miss a beat as its Murdochian family feud continues,"Success hasn't spoiled ""Succession,"" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of ""Veep"" blush.Having become HBO's version of ""Game of Thrones"" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211012181811-01-succession-season-3-episode-1-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/15/entertainment/succession-season-3-review/index.html,entertainment
167,'The Wonder Years' shines in ABC's reboot of the coming-of-age dramedy,"Early '90s TV is hitting the refresh button this fall, in the case of ""The Wonder Years,"" delivering an impressive and ambitious ABC dramedy. Coming on the heels of Disney+'s ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" reboot, the two shows join the earlier ""One Day at a Time"" in proving it's possible to nostalgically recycle titles and still produce distinctive and captivating series.Directed by original star Fred Savage, ""The Wonder Years"" revisits roughly the same period beginning in 1968, this time examining those turbulent years from the perspective of an African-American family and its 12-year-old son, Dean (Elisha ""EJ"" Williams).Once again featuring narration by a grown-up version of the kid (courtesy of Don Cheadle), the elder voice amusingly recalls an era when spanking kids was perfectly okay, his father (""The West Wing's"" Dulé Hill) responded to stressful situations by telling everyone ""Be cool"" and both parents (Saycon Sengbloh plays his mom) were fond of snapping at their kids, ""Stay out of grown folks' business.""As the youngest of three, Dean watches the tumult of the '60s at a greater sense of remove than his teenage sister (Laura Kariuki) and mostly seems preoccupied with a girl in his class, Keisa (Milan Ray). A lot might change in filtering the show through this different point of view, but the pangs of puberty remain universal.Adapted by Saladin K. Patterson, working with a production team that includes Savage and ""Empire's"" Lee Daniels, this new ""Wonder Years"" finds a great deal of humor in seeing the past from this distance. Set in Montgomery, Alabama, Dean attends Jefferson Davis Jr. High and is told reassuringly that a White person isn't racist because ""he watches 'I, Spy.'""Like the prior version, the show unearths the drama and poignant qualities of those years, in a front-loaded pilot that leverages a major event to set the scene and mood -- a logical decision, if a device that the writers will be hard-pressed to replicate in terms of emotional resonance going forward.Both this show and ""Doogie Kamealoha, M.D."" have also nailed the casting of their youthful leads, no small feat with such exercises, with Williams capturing the mix of naivete and awakening that's key to coming-of-age fare.In terms of old-fashioned scheduling concerns that were far more significant when the original aired, ""The Wonder Years"" also looks right at home sandwiched between the nostalgia-tinged ""The Goldbergs"" and ""The Conners,"" a Roseanne-less revival of another '90s staple. (Scheduling isn't a consideration, of course, for those who'll just stream it later on Hulu.)Whether the series can sustain the charms and deft balance that its pilot exhibits remains to be seen; still, just getting out of the gate this looks like one of the fall's most appealing shows, in a way that manages to be, as a musical remnant of the era put it, some kind of ""Wonder""-full.""The Wonder Years"" premieres Sept. 22 at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210902034520-02-the-wonder-years-reboot-abc-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/22/entertainment/the-wonder-years-review/index.html,entertainment
168,"From 'Reservation Dogs' to 'Rutherford Falls,' Native people are having a moment on TV ","When the character Bear is visited by the spirit of an unknown warrior in the series premiere of ""Reservation Dogs,"" he asks if the man before him is ""Crazy Horse"" or another legendary Native American leader.It turns out, however, that the man in the beads and feathers is not the kind of brave or formidable Native hero long romanticized in Hollywood. The unknown warrior instead departed this earth in a most anticlimactic fashion -- his horse tripped over a gopher hole and squashed him dead before the battle even started.""The spirit world is cold,"" he tells Bear. ""My nipples are always hard."" It's a deeply clever and funny scene, one that flips the tired trope of the Indigenous warrior on its head. It winks at Native viewers in the audience, who are all too used to seeing stereotypical portrayals of their people on screen. And it gently mocks those who still think of Native people as relics of the past, as if to say, ""C'mon ... really?""""It's bringing non-Natives into the joke and saying, 'Hey, this is what you think we look like and we're gonna let you laugh at it with us,'"" Sterlin Harjo, a Seminole and Muscogee filmmaker who created ""Reservation Dogs"" with Taika Waititi, told CNN. ""'But it's crazy that you think we still dress like that.'""That tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the elements that makes ""Reservation Dogs,"" the FX series that premiered on Hulu last week, so refreshing. It's also one of two comedies on TV right now about Native Americans, by Native Americans -- ""Rutherford Falls,"" the sitcom that premiered on Peacock earlier this year, has also garnered attention for its layered characters, culturally specific stories and delightful humor.It shouldn't be all that remarkable to see Indigenous people living their lives and having fun on TV, those in the industry say. But when you consider the landscape of onscreen Native representation before this year, the two shows are downright revolutionary.They show Native characters as multidimensionalBefore ""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls,"" the only time Native people really appeared on screen was when ""they were being shot by John Wayne or giving mystical advice to a White person,"" said comedian Joey Clift. A lot of the time, the actors playing Native people weren't even Native themselves.What's different about ""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls"" is that they show Native Americans as multidimensional and existing in the modern era. And rather than having one or two Native characters, they depict entire communities of Indigenous people. ""It's really a breath of fresh air for Native representation,"" Clift, a member of the Cowlitz Tribe, told CNN.""Reservation Dogs"" centers on four rebellious Indigenous teens in rural Oklahoma who yearn to escape to ostensibly greener pastures in California. Along the way, they steal a chip truck, sell meat pies outside of an Indian Health Service clinic and get into fights with a rival crew.""Rutherford Falls"" doesn't focus entirely on Native people, but they are featured on the show in a big way. The series follows a pair of lifelong friends -- Nathan Rutherford, who is White, and Reagan Wells, who is a member of the fictional Minishonka Nation -- whose relationship is put to the test when their small town wants to remove a statue of Nathan's ancestor. As Nathan works to preserve the statue, he finds himself at odds with one of the leaders of Reagan's tribe. The series was recently renewed for another season.Sierra Teller Ornelas, a Navajo and Mexican American showrunner, told CNN that when her co-creators Ed Helms and Michael Schur first approached her about the idea that would eventually become ""Rutherford Falls,"" she knew she wanted the show to have as many Native characters as possible. She wanted to capture the diversity and range of experiences that being Indigenous can encompass. So she did, bringing on Native writers from different backgrounds, tribal nations and regions of the country.""That led to just not only more authentic stories but also better storytelling and funnier ideas,"" she said.They have authentic and specific storiesIn the second episode of ""Reservation Dogs,"" the character Elora ends up at the Indian Health Service clinic for the stomach pains she got from eating too many hot chips. There, she encounters a sarcastic receptionist who can't help but respond to her with withering looks and biting comebacks.Crystal Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and president and CEO of IllumiNative, said she and her daughter cried from laughter while watching the scene -- it was just so familiar. Once when her daughter was younger, she too had to go to the doctor for eating too many hot chips.For other Native people to see themselves reflected in small ways like these is huge, Echo-Hawk said.""We've been told for too long that our stories are too specific to our community and that nobody will get us if we're not in leather and feathers,"" she added. ""'Rutherford Falls' and 'Reservation Dogs' have totally flipped that myth because clearly Americans from all backgrounds like these stories.""That specificity extends to the smaller details too, like when the characters in ""Reservation Dogs"" use the slang terms ""Skoden"" and ""Stoodis."" The shows don't work too hard to explain themselves, staying authentic all while maintaining a universal appeal -- a product of having creative teams and writers' rooms filled with Indigenous people.""We're not holding anyone's hand into this experience,"" Harjo said. ""We are dropping you in the middle of a Native community -- and that's risky.""They capture Native joy""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls"" don't completely ignore the challenges found in Indian Country, but they don't dwell too much on it either.Instead, the focus here is on Native joy.""Reservation Dogs"" was born out of Harjo and Waititi -- who is of Māori descent -- swapping funny stories from back home with each other, Harjo said. The onscreen stories that had existed about Native people up until then were all depressing, and they wanted to make something that would capture just how funny and quirky their communities were. ""Humor was a part of our survival,"" Harjo added. ""To see it not reflected on screen forever was really strange.""The characters in the shows have dreams, aspirations and romantic interests. They get into mischief and crack jokes at each others' expense. Simply put, they're allowed to be.After a pandemic that hit Native people particularly hard, said Ornelas, that joy is a welcome relief.""It's just been a wonderful experience to see that Native joy and to feel like we helped to create that in the show,"" she said.With the success of ""Reservation Dogs"" and ""Rutherford Falls,"" there's perhaps never been a more exciting time for Native American representation on TV. The two shows have set a baseline for what authentic, nuanced depictions of Indigenous people can look like, and have shown that there's an appetite for those stories, too.Already, there's more Native-led storytelling to look forward to: ""Spirit Rangers,"" an animated series about three siblings who can turn into animal spirits to protect their national parks, and ""Rez Ball,"" a coming of age film about a Navajo high school basketball team. Both are being made for Netflix.That momentum is a sign, many say, of bigger and better things to come.",//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210813101929-01-reservation-dogs-small-169.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/18/entertainment/native-american-tv-representation-trnd/index.html,entertainment
